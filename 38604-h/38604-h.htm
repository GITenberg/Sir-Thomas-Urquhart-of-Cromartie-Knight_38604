<div class="figupperleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="90" height="91" alt="" title="" />
</div><p style='text-indent:0px'>EW persons who take an interest in
general literature are wholly unacquainted
with the name of Sir
Thomas Urquhart, as that of the
translator of a great French classic.
Only the more erudite can tell
how the name of another literary man, Pierre
Antoine Motteux, comes to be associated with his
in connexion with the translation in question, and
are aware that the Scottish knight is the author of
original compositions in such diverse departments
as poetry, trigonometry, genealogy, and biography,
and that he played a prominent part in the public
life of his time.</p>

<p>It has been my object to bring together in the
following volume all the materials which are
available for giving a vivid picture of the personality
of Sir Thomas Urquhart, and of the circumstances
in which his life was passed, as I think it would be
a pity if his romantic, fantastical figure were to
pass into oblivion. The materials for his life are
fairly abundant, though they have to be sought for
in many out-of-the-way corners. The slight but
fairly accurate sketch prefixed to his <i>Works</i> in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Maitland Club edition, and the carefully written
articles in Dr Irving's <i>Scottish Writers</i>, and the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, contain the only
previous attempts which have been made to give
his history. The limits within which the authors
of these notices had to work, have, however,
prevented their giving more than a bare outline of
his career. I have attempted, with what success it
is for my readers to say, to clothe the skeleton with
sinews and flesh, and to impart to the figure some
measure of animation.</p>

<p>As I have had to do my work at a great
distance from public libraries, I have been obliged
to enlist the services of friends, more fortunately
situated, in the task of looking up multitudinous
references and allusions, which bore upon the
history of the person in whom I was interested, or
of the time in which he lived. Miss Kemp, James
Walter, Esq., and Alexander Middlemass, Esq.,
Edinburgh, have been extremely serviceable to
me in this way.</p>

<p>A variety of details of historical and biographical
interest has been furnished me by Dr. Milne, King-Edward;
Garden A. Duff, Esq., Hatton Castle,
Turriff; Capt. Douglas Wimberley, Inverness; J. L.
Anderson, Esq., Edinburgh; and P. J. Anderson,
Esq., of Aberdeen University Library.</p>

<p>Professors Crum Brown, Saintsbury, Butcher,
and Eggeling of my own <i>Alma Mater</i> have been
very willing to give the information I have sought
from them; and through Professor Grierson of
Aberdeen I have had the loan of many books
containing material of value for my purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Sheriff Mackenzie, Wick, and Sheriff Shennan,
Lerwick, have aided me in questions of literary
taste and of legal information; and from W. F.
Smith, Esq., Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge,
I have received valuable help in writing the
chapter on the translation of Rabelais. From the
latter's scholarly volumes upon the great Frenchman
I have borrowed some notes, which appear
with his initials attached to them. To Professor
Ferguson of Glasgow I am indebted for the photograph
of Urquhart's handwriting.</p>

<p>In the work of correcting proofs&mdash;a somewhat
laborious task in the present case&mdash;I have had
kindly assistance from Dr Milne, above mentioned,
and also from A. J. Tedder, Esq., London, Rev. T.
Mathewson, Rev. D. Houston, M.A. and J. M.
Goudie, Esq., Lerwick.</p>

<p>If I have omitted the name of any helper, or if
by frivolous comment I have done wrong to the
shade of Sir Thomas, I would adopt the language
of Mr Collins in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. "We are
all liable to err," he says. "I have certainly meant
well through the whole affair; ... and if my
manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg
leave to apologize."</p>

<div class="figupperleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="90" height="78" alt="" title="" />
</div><p>HE right of Sir Thomas Urquhart of
Cromartie to be included in the
list of famous Scots will scarcely
be granted by many of his fellow-countrymen
without some inquiry
into the grounds upon which it
is based. He himself, undoubtedly, would not
have been backward in asserting his claim to such
honourable distinction, though he would have
entered a protest against the presence of some of
those in whose company he would find himself.
In the ecclesiastical and political controversies of
the first half of the seventeenth century, he was,
as an Episcopalian and a Cavalier, connected with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the losing side, and, consequently, it is not to be
expected that posterity should be so impartial as
to cherish his name along with those of the victors
in the conflict. It is to his literary, and not to
his martial achievements, that he owes his fame.
His translation of Rabelais is probably the most
brilliant feat of the kind ever accomplished, and
casts all his own original writings into the shade.
The fantastical character of his own compositions,
indeed, both in regard to their subject-matter and
the diction in which they are clothed, forbids their
ever having a large circle of readers. An author
whose phraseology is like a combination of that
used by Ancient Pistol with that of Sir Thomas
Browne may have enthusiastic admirers, but they
are almost certain to be few in number. Yet his
works contain much interesting matter, and to
them we are indebted for many details of the life
of their author.</p>

<p>Though it is hard to believe Sir Thomas
Urquhart's assertion that the connexion of the
Urquharts with the north-west of Scotland dates as
far back as the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 554, when an ancestor of his
named Beltistos crossed over from Ireland, and built
a castle near Inverness, the family was of considerable
antiquity, and for many generations was one of
the most distinguished in that part of the country.
Nisbet, the great authority on heraldry, says that
"they enjoyed not only the honourable office of
hereditary Sheriff-Principal of the Shire of Cromartie,
but the far greater part, if not the whole of
the said shire did belong to them, either in property<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
or superiority, and they possessed a considerable
estate besides in the Shire of Aberdeen."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
admiralty of the seas from Caithness to Inverness
also belonged to them.</p>

<p>The Urquharts were not, however, the earliest
to bear rule in the part of Scotland with which
their name is connected. Cromartie was originally
the Crwmbawchty (or Crumbathy) of which
Macbeth was reputed thane, before he became
king. Wyntown in his <i>Cronykil</i> relates Macbeth's
dream that he was first Thane of Cromartie, then
Thane of Moray, and then King of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
After the first and second titles had been conferred
upon him, he took steps to secure the third.
Probably the mote-hill of Cromartie was the site<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of his official residence as thane of the district when
he was at the beginning of his ambitious career.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century the family of Mouat
(then <i>de Monte Alto</i>) were in possession,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but early
in the following century the estate had accrued
to King Robert the Bruce, probably because the
Mounts had submitted to the English king,
Edward I. King Robert granted Cromartie to
Sir Hugh Ross, eldest son of William, Earl of
Ross, in 1315, and by him it was afterwards,
in the reign of King David Bruce (1329-70),
given to an Adam of Urquhart ("de Vrquhartt"),<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
with whose descendants it remained for many
generations. In 1357 he got from the Crown
the hereditary sheriffdom of Cromartie, and eight
years later the same Hugh Ross gave him the
estate of Fisherie, in King-Edward, Aberdeenshire.
This Adam is the first of the family to
emerge from the darkness of antiquity into the
light of history, and probably his name, as the
founder of the Urquhart fortunes, suggested the
still more famous progenitor to whom our Sir
Thomas traced back his pedigree link by link, as
our readers will afterwards hear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p><p>Our author's father, also a Thomas, and the
first of his line who was a Protestant in religion,
was born in 1585. He succeeded to the property
in 1603, and in 1617 was knighted by James VI.
in Edinburgh. As he was left an orphan at an
early age, he was brought up under the care of
his grand-uncle, John Urquhart of Craigfintray,
who has been commonly called from this circumstance
"the Tutor of Cromartie."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> His great-grandnephew,
our Sir Thomas, has celebrated his praise in
very high terms. "He was," he says, "over all
Britain renowned for his deep reach of natural wit,
and great dexterity in acquiring of many lands and
great possessions, with all men's applause."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p><p>From all accounts, it seems that the "Tutor" was
faithful in the discharge of all the duties belonging
to his office,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> though he did not succeed in imparting
to his pupil the secret of acquiring landed property,
either with or without applause.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Urquhart, senior, received his estates,
we are informed, "without any burthen of debt,
how little soever, or provision of brother, sister, or
any other of his kindred or allyance wherewith
to affect it."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He married Christian, the fourth
daughter of Alexander, fourth Lord Elphinstone
(1552-1638), and received with her a dowry of
nine thousand merks Scots (<i>i.e.</i> &pound;500 Sterling).
The date of our author's birth is given by Maitland
as 1605, but it is now certain that this is an error,
and that the true date is 1611.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Sir Thomas was
the eldest of the family, and he tells us that he
was born five years after the marriage of his
parents. He also informs us that his mother's
father, Lord Elphinstone, held the office of High
Treasurer in Scotland at the time of the marriage.
As that nobleman was High Treasurer only from
just before 19th April, 1599, till 22nd September,
1601, it would not have been unreasonable to fix
the date of the marriage as probably some time in
1600, if we had no other information on the
subject. But it so happens that the marriage-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>contract
is in existence,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and is dated the 9th of
July, 1606, and consequently Sir Thomas's birth
would fall in the year 1611. Our author must
therefore have been in error in describing his grandfather
as being High Treasurer at the time of his
daughter's marriage. He had, indeed, occupied this
office some years before. Sir Thomas should have
said "had been," instead of "was," but his lordly
disposition of mind would probably make him contemptuous
of such trifles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p><p>In 1611, James <span class="smcap">VI.</span> was drawing near to the end
of the first period of his reign, during which he had
been under the influence of the traditions of the
days of Elizabeth and Burghley, and had not yet
passed into his own keeping, and the hands of profligate
favourites. Bacon was still in the shade of
distrust, from which, however, he was soon to
emerge: he was now, indeed, Solicitor-General, but
his ambition was not satisfied by this post. The
heir-apparent to the throne was Prince Henry, who
died in the following year. Charles, his brother,
was now eleven years of age. Shakespeare brought
out this year his play of <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, and
Ben Jonson his <i>Catiline</i>. Sir Walter Raleigh was
a prisoner in the Tower, and was busily engaged in
writing his <i>History of the World</i>, which he completed
in the following year, though it was not
published until 1614. The Authorised Version of
the English Bible appeared this year. Milton was
now a child of scarcely three years old, and Cromwell
a boy of twelve.</p>

<p>The birthplace of our author is unknown; for
though the castle of Cromartie was the official
residence of the sheriffs, Sir Thomas Urquhart,
senior, is known to have had several other manor-houses,
one of which was Fisherie,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in the parish of
King-Edward, Aberdeenshire, in which he resided
from time to time. It is probable that the future
translator of Rabelais laid the foundation of the
erudition by which in after years he was distinguished,
in Banff,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which then possessed a grammar-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>school,
rather than in the more northern town
which is associated with his name.</p>


<p>Sir Thomas was only eleven years old when, in
1622, he entered the University of Aberdeen,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but
there is no reason to believe that the average age
of the "men" of his year would be in excess of his
own. Donne was the same age as Urquhart when
he entered Oxford. The famous Crichton went up
to St Andrews at the age of ten, though up to that
time he had not given evidence of any extraordinary
precocity. A generation before, Montaigne had
already completed his collegiate course when he
attained his thirteenth year. It seems strange to
us that boys of such tender age should have been
found able to pass through a university curriculum;
and we are forced to conclude either that the boys
of those days were intellectually superior to those
with whom we are familiar, or that the studies
which occupied them were less deep and severe
than those which are now pursued in seats of
learning. The latter is probably the true explanation
of the matter. University education in Scot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>land
had been remodelled, and adapted to the
requirements of the time and of a Protestant society
in the previous generation, and in this work Andrew
Melville had a very notable part. In 1583 a new
constitution had been drawn up for the University
of Aberdeen, and the arrangements prescribed by it
may have existed there when our author was a
student. The Principal, according to this constitution,
was Professor of Theology, as well as incumbent
of the parish of Old Machar, and was responsible
for the government and discipline of the college.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Under him were four Regents, one of whom was
Sub-Principal, and to them was assigned the duty of
training students in various departments of learning.
Thus physiology, geography, astrology, history, and
Hebrew were assigned to the Sub-Principal. Another
Regent explained "the principles of reasoning
from the best Greek and Latin authors, with practice
in writing and speaking"; while a third
lectured upon Greek, and read the more elementary
Latin and Greek authors. The fourth Regent
taught arithmetic and geometry, and, along with
them, a portion of Aristotle's <i>Organon, Ethics, and
Politics</i>, and Cicero's <i>De Officiis</i>. This attempt to
assign special departments to the various regents
respectively, was a marked improvement upon the
older system, under which they were each responsible
for teaching all the subjects included in the
curriculum.</p>

<p>The students paid fees, which varied in amount<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
according to their social standing. On entering the
university they were required to take an oath of
loyalty to the Reformed religion. None were
allowed to carry arms, or to converse in any other
tongue than Greek or Latin. Perhaps, however,
this latter rule was merely an attempt to restrain
the measureless tide of human speech. And in
order that nothing might interfere with the progress
of the students, the <i>Nova Fundatio</i>, or new constitution
of Aberdeen University, abolished all holidays
("omnes consuetas olim a studiis vacationes aboleri
penitus").<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Thomas Urquhart's name does not appear in
the list of graduates in 1626, so that there are no
means of determining from the records of King's
College how many years he spent there. For the
city in which he had received his education he ever
afterwards had a high regard. Thus he says of it:
"For honesty, good fashions, and learning, Aberdeen
surpasseth as far all other cities and towns in Scotland,
as London doth for greatness, wealth, and magnificence,
the smallest hamlet or village in England."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>He gives unmeasured praise to some of those
eminent men who were associated with the fame
of Aberdeen University in what has been called its
"Augustan age"&mdash;the first four or five decades of
the seventeenth century. Thus, according to him,
William Lesley, D.D.,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was "one of the most profound
and universal scholars then living"&mdash;like
Socrates in having published no works, but, unfortunately,
unlike that philosopher in not having
among his disciples a Plato and an Aristotle to
receive their master's knowledge and transmit it to
future generations.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Of his successor in the principalship,
Dr William Guild, he says: "He deserveth
by himself to be remembered, both for that
he hath committed to the press many good books,
tending to the edification of the soul, and bettering
of the minde; and that of all the divines that have
lived in Scotland these hundred yeers, he hath been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the most charitable, and who bestowed most of his
own to publike uses."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> At the time when he
wrote these estimates of the sages at whose feet he
had sat as a student, some of his old friends were
under a cloud, and he had to be careful not to
compromise them by his praise. And so he says
of "Master William [?] Seaton," who had been his
tutor, "[he was] a very able preacher truly, and
good scholar, and [one] whom I would extoll yet
higher, but that being under the consistorian lash,
some critick Presbyters may do him injury, by pretending
his dislike of them, for being praised by
him who idolizeth not their authority."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>At the time of the marriage of Sir Thomas
Urquhart, senior, Lord Elphinstone, who was fully
acquainted with the prosperous condition of his
son-in-law's affairs, made him pledge himself to
manage his property so that it might descend to
his heir as he had himself received it. Unfortunately
this pledge was not fulfilled. Through mismanagement
and neglect his affairs got into disorder,
and the later years of his life were troubled
by pecuniary difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> His son says of him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
"Of all men living [he was] the justest, equallest,
and most honest in his dealings, [and] his humour
was, rather than to break his word, to lose all he had,
and stand to his most undeliberate promises, what
ever they might cost; which too strict adherence
to the austerest principles of veracity, proved
oftentimes dammageable to him in his negotiations
with many cunning sharks, who knew with what
profitable odds they could scrue themselves in upon
the windings of so good a nature.... By the
unfaithfulnes, on the one side, of some of his
menial servants, in filching from him much of his
personal estate, and falsehood of several chamberlains
and bayliffs to whom he had intrusted the
managing of his rents, in the unconscionable discharge
of their receits, by giving up one account
thrice, and of such accounts many; and, on the
other part, by the frequency of disadvantagious
bargains, which the slieness of the subtil merchant
did involve him in, his loss came unawares upon
him, and irresistibly, like an armed man; too great
trust to the one, and facility in behalf of the other,
occasioning so grievous a misfortune, which nevertheless
did not proceed from want of knowledge or
abilitie in natural parts, for in the business of other
men he would have given a very sound advice, and
was surpassing dextrous in arbitrements, upon any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
reference submitted to him, but that hee thought it
did derogate from the nobility of his house and
reputation of his person, to look to petty things in
matter of his own affairs."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>One of the ways in which the elder Sir Thomas
succeeded in impoverishing himself and his family
was in becoming bail for people who absconded; so,
at least, we would infer from an entry in the
Court-book of the Burgh of Banff under date of
21st April, 1629, in which we find that "Sir
Thomas Urquhurt of Cromarty, having become
caution for the appearance of Alexander Forbes,
merchant in Balvenye, alleged forestaller, and the
said Alexander not having appeared, Sir Thomas is
decerned to pay &pound;40 Scots (&pound;3, 6s. 8d. Sterling)."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In 1637 we find that he was obliged to appeal
to his sovereign against the urgency of his creditors,
and a Letter of Protection was issued in his favour.
It ran as follows: "Letter of Protection granted by
King Charles the First, under his great seal, to Sir
Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, from all dilligence
at the instance of his creditors, for the space of one
year, thereby giving him a <i>persona standi in judicio</i>,
notwithstanding he may be at the horn, and taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
him under his royal protection during the time.
Dated at St James's, 20th March, 1637."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A
somewhat humorous situation is suggested by this
document. The creditors might "put him to the
horn," <i>i.e.</i>, according to the usual legal form, order
him in the king's name to pay his debts on penalty
of being outlawed as a traitor, while the king himself
authorised him to take no notice of the proceedings.</p>

<p>In the same year we have intimation of the
elder Sir Thomas's pecuniary misfortunes being
aggravated by domestic strife, for we find him
instructing a high legal functionary to raise an
action against his sons, Thomas and Alexander, for
their unfilial conduct. The charge was that of
"putting violent hands on the persone of the said
Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromartie, Knycht, their
father, taking him captive and prissoner, and
detening him in sure firmance within ane upper
chalmer, callit the Inner Dortour, within his place
of Cromertie, <i>tanquam in privato carcere</i>, fra the
Mononday to the Fryday in the efter none therefter,
committit in the moneth of December last, 1636."
The case came up for trial before the Court of
Justiciary on the 19th of July, and was postponed
for a week, when it was abandoned. The Lords of
Council had appointed a commission to settle all
differences between the father and sons and on
receiving their report the Court dismissed the
case.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> We have no particulars as to the causes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
disagreement which led to such all unhappy state
of affairs, but we are not likely to be far wrong in
assuming that the sons wished to prevent their
father's taking some legal step which they considered
would be detrimental to his and their
interests. The affectionate terms in which our
author describes his father's character ten years
after his death, in the words above quoted, make
us sure that he sincerely regretted any wrong
towards him of which he may have been guilty at
this time.</p>

<p>The old castle of Cromartie has now long disappeared,
the stones of which it was built having
been used for the erection of a modern house in
1772, after the estate had passed, by purchase,
from the family of Urquhart to Mr George Ross.
It was a building of considerable antiquity. In
1470 a royal grant was made by James III. to
William Urquhart of the Motehill, or Mount of
Cromartie, with permission to erect on this a tower
or fortalice. Advantage was taken of this permission
to fortify the family mansion, and it was
converted into a castle of considerable strength.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Sir Thomas says of it: "The stance thereof is
stately, and the house it selfe of a notable good
fabrick and contrivance."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> An interesting description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the building as it was just before its demolition
is given by Hugh Miller. "Directly behind the
site of the old town," he says, "the ground rises
abruptly from the level to the height of nearly a
hundred feet, after which it forms a kind of table-land
of considerable extent, and then sweeps gently
to the top of the hill. A deep ravine, with a little
stream running through it, intersects the rising
ground at nearly right angles with the front which
it presents to the houses; and on the eastern
angle, towering over the ravine on the one side, and
the edge of the bank on the other, stood the old
castle of Cromarty. It was a massy, time-worn
building, rising in some places to the height of six
storeys, battlemented at the top, and roofed with
grey stone. One immense turret jutted out from
the corner, which occupied the extreme point of the
angle, and looking down from an altitude of at least
one hundred and sixty feet on the little stream,
and the struggling row of trees which sprung up at
its edge, commanded both sides of the declivity and
the town below." Of the interior we are told by
the same writer, on the authority of an old woman
who, as a child, had lived in the castle, that "two
threshers could have plied their flails within the
huge chimney of the kitchen; and that, in the great
hall, an immense, dark chamber, lined with oak, a
party of a hundred men had exercised at the pike."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The elder Sir Thomas had also a winter residence
in Banff.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In the Court-book of the Burgh of Banff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
we have the following entry: "1630, July 21st, Sir
Thomas Urquhart of Cromartie gave in ane Act of
the Session of Banff, geiveing licence to him to erect
ane desk and loft in the kirk of Banff (seeing he is
both a parochiner and resident within the said toun)
for his accomodatione. The brethren gave their
approbatione with express provision that neither
the edifice nor lichtes of the said kirk suld be
deteriorat."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Beyond the bare fact of his having been a
student in the University of Aberdeen, we have no
information concerning the manner in which the
earlier years of our author's life were passed, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
circumstances in which he acquired the miscellaneous
erudition which his writings display. The
only remark he makes about the education he
received is to the effect that his father laid out but
a very insignificant portion of his income upon this
item of family expenses. Yet, however little the
expenditure may have been, Urquhart evidently
profited fully by the education which he had
received, and attained to something more than a
gentlemanly acquaintance with some of the abstruser
departments of learning.</p>

<p>The special bent of his mind in early years, and
his love for study rather than sport, are shown in
the following reminiscence of his youth, which he
narrates with his characteristic diffuseness. "There
happening," he says, "a gentleman of very good
worth to stay awhile at my house, who, one day
amongst many other, was pleased, in the deadst
time of all the winter, with a gun upon his shoulder,
to search for a shot of some wild-fowl; and after
he had waded through many waters, taken excessive
pains in quest of his game, and by means thereof
had killed some five or six moor fowls and partridges,
which he brought along with him to my house, he
was by some other gentlemen, who chanced to alight
at my gate, as he entered in, very much commended
for his love to sport; and, as the fashion of most
of our countrymen is, not to praise one without
dispraising another, I was highly blamed for not
giving my self in that kind to the same exercise,
having before my eys so commendable a pattern to
imitate; I answered, though the gentleman deserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
praise for the evident proof he had given that day
of his inclination to thrift and laboriousness, that
nevertheless I was not to blame, seeing whilst he
was busied about that sport, I was imployed in a
diversion of another nature, such as optical secrets,
mysteries of natural philosophie, reasons for the
variety of colours, the finding out of the longitude,
the squaring of a circle, and wayes to accomplish
all trigonometrical calculations by sines, without
tangents, with the same compendiousness of computation,&mdash;which,
in the estimation of learned men,
would be accounted worth six hundred thousand
partridges, and as many moor-fowles."</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Sir Thomas had
the best of the argument. But he was not satisfied
with this: for nothing less would content him than
vanquishing his opponent on his own ground, as
well as with the weapons of logic. With the same
lordliness of temper which had led him to re-capitulate
the dignified subjects which had occupied
his studious mind&mdash;the squaring of the circle being
but one of them&mdash;he chose the breaking-in of a
horse as a set-off against his friend's achievements
of the day before. The success of the scientific
student and the discomfiture of the mere sportsman
are told in the conclusion of the story. "In the
mean while," he says, "that worthy gentleman, being
wet and weary after travel, was not able to eat of
what he had so much toyled for, whilst my braine
recreations so sharpened my appetite, that I supped
to very good purpose. That night past, the next
morning I gave six pence to a footman of mine, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
try his fortune with the gun, during the time I
should disport my self in the breaking of a young
horse; and it so fell out, that by [the time] I had
given my selfe a good heat by riding, the boy returned
with a dozen of wild fouls, half moor foule,
half partridge, whereat being exceeding well pleased,
I alighted, gave him my horse to care for, and forthwith
entred in to see my gentlemen, the most
especiall whereof was unable to rise out of his bed,
by reason of the Gout and Sciatick, wherewith he
was seized for his former daye's toyle."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In the early years of his manhood, before our
author felt himself qualified to take part in public
life, he spent some time in foreign travel. The
kind of figure cut by a young <i>English</i> gentleman of
that period upon the Continent we know from the
testimony of Portia, for it can scarcely be that
much change had taken place in the interval of a
generation, between her time and the end of the
first quarter of the seventeenth century. He was
generally unversed in the languages of the countries
he visited, and, from his lack of Latin, French, or
Italian, was apt to fail in understanding the natives,
or in making himself understood by them. He might
be handsome in figure, but conversation with him
was reduced to the level of a dumb-show. His
dress was often very odd, and his manners eccentric,
as though he had bought his doublet in Italy, his
round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and
his behaviour&mdash;everywhere. A strong contrast to
him in the matter of language was the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Scotchman of the period, if Sir Thomas Urquhart
is to be taken as at all an average specimen of his
nation, and if his account of himself can be relied
upon. He says of himself that when he travelled
through France, Spain, and Italy, he spoke the
languages to such perfection that he might easily
have passed himself off as a native of any one of
these countries. Some advised him to do so, but
his patriotic feelings were too strong to allow him
to follow such a course: "he plainly told them
(without making bones thereof), that truly he thought
he had as much honour by his own country, which
did contrevalue the riches and fertility of those
nations, by the valour, learning, and honesty,
wherein it did parallel, if not surpass them."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult for the mind to grasp
the idea of a Scotchman in those days, when so
many of the things which we now associate with
the nationality were not in existence&mdash;when his
Church was Episcopalian in constitution, the Shorter
Catechism not yet written by Englishmen for his
use, Burns unborn, and distilled spirits not extensively
used as a beverage. We could scarcely even
know him by his costume. For no self-respecting
representative of that country would assume the
Highland garb which so many Englishmen believe to
be generally worn north of the Tweed, if we are to
credit the authoritative statement of Macaulay to
the effect that "before the Union it was considered
by nine Scotchmen out of ten as the dress of a
thief."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The characteristics by which "a Scot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
abroad" in those days was recognised, were, from
some accounts, not shrewdness in making bargains,
economical habits, indomitable perseverance, and
unsleeping caution, but the pride and high-spiritedness
which made him keen in detecting and swift
in avenging slights that might be cast upon the
country from which he came. So deep was the
impression made by these peculiarities upon foreign
nations, that they became proverbial. "He is a
Scot, he has pepper in his nose!"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> said they, somewhat
familiarly, yet with a touch of fear, when they
noticed the flashing eye, and the hand instinctively
seeking the sword-hilt. "High-spirited as a Scot!"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
they exclaimed with admiration, when among themselves
some soul was moved to unwonted courage.
Such, at least, is the impression produced upon the
mind by some of those novels in which Scott and
his imitators trace the wanderings of their fellow-countrymen
through European lands in those
earlier times. That there is some foundation of
truth for the lofty superstructure is rendered
credible by the case of Sir Thomas Urquhart.
"My heart,"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> he says, "gave me the courage for
adventuring in a forrain climat, thrice to enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the lists against men of three severall nations, to
vindicate my native country<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> from the calumnies
wherewith they had aspersed it; wherein it pleased
God so to conduct my fortune, that, after I had
disarmed them, they in such sort acknowledged
their error, and the obligation they did owe me for
sparing their lives, which justly by the law of arms
I might have taken, that, in lieu of three enemies
that formerly they were, I acquired three constant
friends, both to my selfe and my compatriots,
whereof by severall gallant testimonies they gave
evident proofe, to the improvement of my country's
credit in many occasions."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>


<p>The fair critic, whose estimate of the young
Englishman has been referred to, gives her opinion
also of his Scottish rival; but, strangely enough,
she observes in him qualities of a kind opposite
to those displayed by Sir Thomas Urquhart. She
was struck by his neighbourly charity, "for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and
swore he would pay him back again when he was
able."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Can it be that the words put into her
mouth are merely the ribald wit of an envious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Southron, or are we to understand that the spirit
which triumphed over so many inferiors was yet
wise enough to discern when it stood in the presence
of a mightier than itself?</p>

<p>How a young man on his travels should occupy
his time, had been laid down in a little volume
which had been published just before Urquhart
set out to see the world abroad. In this he might
read a list of the things which should engage his
attention, drawn up in sonorous language by no
less a personage than a late Lord Chancellor of
England&mdash;a man who was ready to give advice to
all his fellow-creatures in all conceivable circumstances.
"The things," says Lord Bacon, "to be

house and gardens of state and pleasure near great
cities; armories, arsenals, magazines, exchanges,
burses, warehouses; exercises of horsemanship,
fencing, training of soldiers, and the like; comedies,
such whereunto the better sort of persons do resort;
treasuries of jewels and robes, cabinets and rarities;

<p>To what extent Urquhart followed a plan of this
kind it is impossible to say; for, though his
writings are so discursive that we might expect
to find in them allusions to anything remarkable
he had seen or heard, he has very little to say
about his foreign experiences. Dr Johnson spoke
with contempt of an English peer, who had extended
his travels as far as Egypt, but who had brought
back only one small contribution to the general
stock of human information&mdash;the fact that he had
seen "a large serpent in one of the pyramids of
Egypt." Urquhart was not quite so poverty-stricken
as this; for he seems to have observed
examples of mental infirmity, illustrations of which
he might doubtless have found nearer home.</p>

<p>"I saw at Madrid," he says, "a bald-pated fellow
who beleeved he was Julius C&aelig;sar, and therefore
went constantly on the streets with a laurel crown
on his head; and another at Toledo, who would
not adventure to goe abroad unlesse it were in a
coach, chariot, or sedane, for fear the heavens should
fall down upon him. I likewise saw one in Saragosa,
who, imagining himself to be the lawfull King
of Aragon, went no where without a scepter in his
hand; and another in the kingdome of Granada,
who beleeved he was the valiant Cid that conquered
the Mores. At Messina, in Sicilie, I also saw a
man that conceived himself to be the great Alexander
of Macedone, and that in a ten years space he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
should be master of all the territories which he
subdued; but the best is, that the better to
resemble him he always held his neck awry,
which naturally was streight and upright enough;
and another at Venice, who imagined he was
Soveraign of the whole Adriatick Sea, and sole
owner of all the ships that came from the Levante.
Of men that fancied themselves to be women, beasts,
trees, stones, pitchers, glasse, angels, and of women
whose strained imaginations have falne upon the
like extravagancies, even in the midst of fire and
the extremest pains fortune could inflict upon them,
there is such variety of examples, amongst which
I have seen some at Rome, Naples, Florence, Genua,
Paris, and other eminent cities, that to multiply
any moe [more] words therein, were to load your
ears with old wives' tales, and the trivial tattle of
idly imployed and shallow braind humorists."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>He also tells, though not in the same connexion,
of his having been witness of the honour and
admiration lavished upon one of his fellow-countrymen,
Dr Seaton, by the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Parisian society.
"I have seen him," he says, "circled about at
the Louvre with a ring of French lords and
gentlemen, who hearkned to his discourse with
so great attention, that none of them, so long as
he was pleased to speak, would offer to interrupt
him, to the end that the pearles falling from his
mouth might be the more orderly congested in the
several treasures of their judgements."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Part of his time abroad was devoted to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
fascinating occupation of book-hunting, and he had
great pleasure in the spoils he had won. When
they were set in order on shelves in the library of
the castle of Cromartie, he looked on them with the
joy which only book-collectors know. "They were,"
he says, "like to a compleat nosegay of flowers, which,
in my travels, I had gathered out of the gardens
of above sixteen several kingdoms."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

the charter, having been owner of Cromartie, was claimed by Sir

fourteen years of age, and for girls until twelve. After these ages

name as his father, the mistake is often made of asserting that
John Urquhart was <i>his</i> tutor.</p></div>

date of the marriage is by a document now in the Register
House in Edinburgh (<i>Aberdeen Sasines</i>), in which Sir Thomas
Urquhart, senior, gives sasine of the barony of Fisherie to Lady
Christian Elphinstone. The "precept," or clause in the marriage-contract,
which directs the notary to give sasine of the estate
settled on the bride, is also dated the 9th of July, 1606, and in it she
is described as being <i>in su&acirc; pur&acirc; virginitate</i>. Probably the
marriage took place either on that day or very soon afterwards.
The bridegroom was just of age, while Lady Christian was under
sixteen, the date of her birth being 19th December, 1590 (<i>The

our author could have got the rudiments of a classical
education. In 1649 (15th Nov.), Mr James Petrie, who was school-master
there, applied for the school of Banff and, as a test of his
power, "was ordeined to teache the sext satyr of Persius to-morrow
in the school of Banf be nyne hours in presence of the
bailyies and others in the toune who wer scholars." He passed
through the test successfully, and was appointed to the office

into the establishment under his charge. It is probable, however,
that in Mr Squeers's case the arrangement was the result of independent
research into methods of education, rather than a hint
borrowed from Andrew Melville. "No holidays&mdash;none of those
ill-judged comings home twice a year that unsettle children's

</p><p>
It is only fair to say that there are doubts as to how far the
arrangements under the <i>Nova Fundatio</i>, as above described, were
in force in Sir Thomas Urquhart's student days. If the older
system were still in operation, the Alexander Lunan, who is mentioned
as his preceptor, would virtually have taught our author
all the subjects contained in the curriculum through which he
passed. As there is no proof that Alexander Lunan was another
Admirable Crichton, the fact of his doing so would strengthen
what we have said above as to the comparative slightness of the
erudition imparted in a university education in those days. Sir
Thomas Urquhart speaks of having "learned the elements of
his philosophy" in the University of Aberdeen under William
Seaton (<i>Works</i>, p. 263). It has been suggested that it is an error
for John Seaton, and that it indicates that our author, like many
other students of King's College, took a session or two at Marischal
College (see Anderson's <i>Fasti Acad. Marisc.</i> ii. 34, 588).</p></div>

</div><p>HILE Urquhart was engaged in
foreign travel, the ecclesiastical
and political controversies
in Scotland came to such a
height, that it was evident
that matters could only be settled by an appeal
to the sword, and, accordingly, he returned home
to assist the party to which his family adhered.
He, doubtless, like Milton, considered it disgraceful
that, while his fellow-countrymen were fighting at
home for liberty, he should be travelling abroad for
amusement and intellectual culture. His father,
who had been the first of the Urquharts to give
up Roman Catholicism for Protestantism, took the
unpopular side in the conflict that agitated the
Church of Scotland. He was a staunch Episcopalian,
and refused to accept the National Covenant,
when those who had voluntarily and enthusiastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ally
entered into it attempted to coerce others
into following their example, and so turned it into
an instrument of tyranny.</p>

<p>The determined efforts of Charles I. and his
advisers to make the Church of Scotland in all
respects like the Church of England, were fiercely
opposed, and, for a time, the party which was resolved
to make them as dissimilar as possible prevailed.
Episcopacy, liturgy, ancient ecclesiastical customs
and rites, and all that savoured of Prelacy or
Popery, were swept away by the rising flood. Yet,
without committing oneself to the doctrine of
passive obedience, it may be doubted whether the
course of policy followed by the Covenanters was
either wise or scriptural. For, notwithstanding
the vehement protestations of loyalty expressed in
the National Covenant, armed resistance to the
royal authority was not obscurely hinted at in it.
"We," said the subscribers, "promise and swear
by the great name of the Lord our God to continue
in the profession and obedience of the said religion;
and that we shall defend the same, and resist all
those contrary errors and corruptions, according to
our vocation, and to the utmost of that power which
God hath put into our hands, all the days of our
life." It is quite possible, it may be hoped, for one
to be in sympathy with a certain political party,
and yet to regret that the Church should identify
itself with that party; and it certainly was not in
the end a good thing for the cause of religion that
it should have been so closely allied as it was with
party politics in the seventeenth century. "My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
kingdom is not of this world," said Christ; "if My
kingdom were of this world, then would My servants
fight." "Put up again thy sword into his place,"
He said to St Peter, "for all they that take the
sword, shall perish with the sword." It is difficult
to see how these clear and emphatic utterances can
be made to harmonise with the resolution not only
to use force in the correction of ecclesiastical abuses
and religious errors, but also to coerce those who were
not prepared to follow the same course of policy.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The Covenanting party were successful beyond
their hopes. The influence of the Marquis of
Argyle secured the allegiance to the cause of the
Highlanders in the west of Scotland; while, in
Inverness and the region north of the Moray
Firth, the movement was enthusiastically welcomed.
Only one district in Scotland held aloof&mdash;that of
which Aberdeen was the centre. The community
there had probably but little sympathy with the
innovations which Laud was bent upon bringing
in, but they had still less with the Covenant.
They were attached to the modified form of Episcopacy
which had now existed in Scotland since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Reformation (with the exception of the years between
1592 and 1610), in which the bishops were little
more than permanent moderators of Presbyteries,
and were subject to the General Assembly, and in
which the ritual was of a very simple character.</p>

<p>As a University and Cathedral city, and the residence
of a large number of wealthy landed proprietors,
Aberdeen occupied a position of great importance
in Scotland, and was by no means under the
command of the capital. The heads of the
Covenanting party very speedily found it necessary
to take steps for bringing this corner of the kingdom
into subjection to themselves. They could
scarcely hope to succeed in overcoming the powerful
forces at the command of the English Government,
if they were to allow this enemy to remain undisturbed
in their rear.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at a very early stage in the proceedings,
they attempted to gain over to their side
the great territorial magnate of the district, the
Marquis of Huntly, who, from his rank and wealth
and hereditary loyalty to the throne, was likely to be
the leader of the King's party in the North. Had
they succeeded, they would virtually have had the
whole country at their back, for the community
of Aberdeen, and the few neighbouring lairds, who,
like Sir Thomas Urquhart, refused to accept the
Covenant, would not have dared to resist the
national policy by force of arms. In the negotiations
between the Covenanting leaders and the
Marquis of Huntly, we have an illustration of the
very muddy roads along which religion is dragged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
when it forms an alliance with a political party.
It is certainly with somewhat of a shock that one
who is under the impression that all the Covenanters
were saints of a very spiritually-minded
type, learns of the grim option which they offered
to their possible opponent. Colonel Robert Munro,
who had seen service in Germany, was appointed
to wait upon the Marquis at Strathbogie, and to
acquaint him with the resolutions to which the
Covenanters had come. "The sum of his commission
to Huntly was," we are told, "that the
noblemen Covenanters were desirous that he should
join with them in the common cause; that, if he
would do so, and take the Covenant, they would
give him the first place, and make him leader of
their forces; and, further, they would make his
state and his fortunes greater than ever they were;
and, moreover, they should pay off and discharge
all his debts, which they knew to be about one
hundred thousand pounds sterling; that their
forces and associates were a hundred to one
[in comparison] with the king; and, therefore, it
was to no purpose to him to take up arms against
them, for if he refused this offer and declared
against them, they should find means to disable
him for to help the king; and, moreover, they
knew how to undo him, and bade him to expect
that they will ruinate his family and estates."
The hands were, perhaps, the hands of Christian,
the voice was certainly the voice of Mr Worldly
Wiseman!</p>

<p>The reply of the Marquis was admirable for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
spirit of generosity and chivalry which it breathed.
"To this proposition," we are told, "Huntly gave
a short and resolute repartee, that his family had
risen and stood by the kings of Scotland; and for
his part, if the event proved the ruin of this king,
he was resolved to lay his life, honours, and estate
under the rubbish of the king's ruins."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Though Sir Thomas Urquhart, senior, was a
staunch Episcopalian and a devoted Royalist, the
circumstances in which he was placed forbade his
aiding the ecclesiastical and political causes which
were dear to him with more than good wishes.
He was surrounded by neighbours of the opposite
party,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and isolated from those with whom he would
gladly have co-operated. Consequently, it remained
for his eldest son, our author, who apparently was
residing at that time at Balquholly Castle, in
Aberdeenshire, where the adherents of the Royalist
cause were numerous, to play a more heroic part.</p>

<p>Between the date of the signing of the Covenant
and that of the meeting of the General Assembly
in Glasgow in 1638, The Tables, for such was the
name by which the executive government estab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>lished
by the revolutionary party was designated,
decided to subdue the city of Aberdeen and the
neighbouring country, and to compel the people
there to accept the Covenant. Before resorting
to force, however, an attempt was made to persuade.
A committee of three eminent clergymen, Henderson,
Dickson, and Cant, with the Earl of Montrose
as president, was sent north to deal with the
somewhat unimpressible Aberdonians. The hospitable
corporation of the northern city invited the
visitors to a banquet of wine, but their invitation
was scornfully declined. The deputation "would
drink with none till first the Covenant was subscribed."
Such incivility was new in the history
of the city, and a very satisfactory rebuke was
given to it by the materials for the proposed
banquet being distributed among the poor. It
can be easily imagined that after this unsatisfactory
beginning the sermons delivered by the clerical
deputation fell upon unsympathetic ears, and made
but few converts. "The commissioners had one
powerful ally in the town, in the person of Earl
Marischal, the son of the founder of the College,
who had died in 1623; and, when they were
refused licence to preach in the city churches, they
adjourned to his residence at the north end of
what is now Marischal Street. The mansion
consisted of several buildings with galleries surrounding
a courtyard, and from these galleries the
three Covenanting ministers held forth from eight
o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon,
trying to convince the people of the truth of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Covenant. The children of granite, however,
proved absolutely impervious to the 'apostles,'
whom they scornfully pelted with mud."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>A paper-war, which attracted considerable notice,
sprang up between the commissioners and six of
the Aberdeen clergy&mdash;popularly designated in contemporary
literature as "the Aberdeen Doctors."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
In this warfare the representatives of the Covenanting
party came off rather badly. "The position
taken by the Doctors," says John Hill Burton,
"is the unassailable one of the dry sarcastic
negative. Whatever the Covenant might be&mdash;good
or bad&mdash;and whatever right its approvers had to
bind themselves to it, how were they entitled to
force it on those who desired it not? And when
their adversaries became eloquent on its conformity
to Scripture and the privileges of the Christian
Church, the Doctors ever went back to the same
negative position&mdash;even if it were so, which we
do not admit, yet why force it upon us?"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Early in the following year, 1639, The Tables
resolved to suppress the northern Malignants, as
they were called, before preparing to enter on a
campaign against their enemy in the south, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
thus save themselves from the dangers involved in
having an enemy in their rear. The Earl of Montrose
went north at the head of a considerable
body of troops, and took possession of Aberdeen.
The opponents of the Covenant fled from the city,
and Huntly, the leader of the Royalists, felt unable
to offer effective resistance. In spite of a safe-conduct
granted him by Montrose on his coming in
to a conference, he was taken prisoner to Edinburgh
and lodged in the Castle.</p>

<p>This kidnapping of the Royalist chief caused
great irritation; and upon a rumour of the fleet's
coming to the Firth of Forth, and of the Royal
army's approach to the Scottish border, the
northern Royalists, of whom our Sir Thomas
Urquhart was one, resolved to take arms on the
King's side. The first mention of our author in
history is in connexion with this rising; and the
annalist Spalding relates two exciting incidents that
occurred in one week, in both of which he took part.</p>

<p>The first, which happened on Friday, the 10th of
May, was an attempt made by him and some of
the other Royalist lairds or "barons," as they are
called,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to take the castle of Towie-Barclay,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Aberdeenshire. It seems that the lairds of Delgatie
and Towie-Barclay had plundered the house of
Balquholly,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which was occupied by our author, and
carried off a large supply of "muskets, guns, and
carabines." Sir Thomas was not a man to submit
quietly to such an outrage as this; and, doubtless,
to his desire for vengeance was added a strong wish
to get possession of the firearms, now that there
was a good cause to be defended and brave men to
use the weapons. They had intended to surprise
the castle, but when they came to it they found
the gates shut, and the place strongly guarded.
Lord Fraser and the eldest son of Lord Forbes
had already known that an attempt was to be
made to recover the weapons, and had manned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the castle so effectually that the idea of storming
it was out of the question. A few shots were
exchanged, and then the attacking party rode away.
The only casualty was the death of a David Prott,
who was a servant of the laird of Gight,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> one of
Urquhart's friends. "This," the historian remarks,
"was the first time that blood was drawn here
since the beginning of the Covenant."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Four days after, a more serious encounter took
place between the two forces. The Covenanters of
the north had decided to assemble in force, and
fixed upon Turriff, in Aberdeenshire, as their headquarters.
The Royalists drew to a head at Strathbogie,
some eleven miles off, and resolved to disperse
their opponents. The Covenanting party was
about twelve hundred strong, and the Royalists
about eight hundred, but the latter had four brass
cannon, which very materially strengthened them
as an attacking force. They were under the
leadership of skilful officers, among whom Arthur
Forbes of Blacktown [in King-Edward] is specially
mentioned. Sir Thomas himself informs us
that, "having obtained, though with a great deal
of pain, a fifteen hundreth [hundred] subscriptions
to a bond conceived and drawn up in
opposition of the vulgar [popular] Covenant, he
selected from amongst them so many as he
thought fittest for holding hand to [taking in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
hand] the dissolving of their committees and unlawful
meetings."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>About ten o'clock on the night of Monday, the
13th of May, they started for Turriff, marching in
a "very quiet and sober manner," and by daybreak
managed to steal upon the village by an
unguarded path. The sound of trumpets and of
drums aroused the unsuspecting Covenanters to
the fact that they had been fairly surprised.
"Some were sleeping, others drinking, and smoaking
tobacco, others walking up and down." A
few volleys of musketry, and a few shots discharged
from the cannon, served to disperse them, and the
village was taken possession of by the attacking
force. It was but a slight skirmish,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in which
three men were killed, two of the Covenanters,
and one of the Royalists; but it was the first
of the battles in the great Civil War, which
raged for so many years, and deluged with blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
so many fruitful plains in each of the three kingdoms.
On this account "the Trot of Turriff," as
it was called, should not be forgotten.</p>


<p>After this victory, the Royalists being masters of
the village, the common soldiers, who were hungry
after their night's march, plundered the houses of
those they thought were Covenanters, and supplied
themselves with meat and drink. The greatest loss
fell upon the minister, Mr Mitchell, who, however,
received very liberal compensation from Parliament
in the following year. They next gathered as many
of the inhabitants of Turriff together as they could
find, and made them accept and subscribe the King's
Covenant.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This device for securing adherents was,
however, ineffectual, for, a few weeks later, those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
who had sworn to the King's Covenant, on a
declaration that they had acted under compulsion,
were solemnly absolved by their minister from all
obligation to keep it.</p>

<p>The Royalist leaders now began to think of
further projects, as the number of their followers
increased after the victory at Turriff. They lost
no time in marching upon Aberdeen, and in quartering
themselves upon its inhabitants, especially upon
those who were known to belong to the Covenanting
party. In a few days, however, they found
their position untenable. A considerable number
of their Highland forces disbanded, and marched
away to their homes, plundering as they went&mdash;"a
thing," the historian remarks, "verye usuall with
them." The others retreated from Aberdeen, when
the Covenanting army under the Earl Marischal
entered the city, on the 23rd of May, 1639.</p>

<p>A small number of prominent Royalists,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> of
whom our Sir Thomas was one, now resolved to
leave Scotland, where the cause to which they
were devoted was at such a low ebb. A ship,
belonging to one Andrew Findlay, had been kept
in readiness for an emergency like this, and on it
they embarked hastily, and sailed away to England,
to offer their services to Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span> "Urquhart,"
says Dr Irving, "who professes to have launched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
forth in the view of six hundred of his enemies,
was, within two days, landed at Berwick, where he
found the Marquis of Hamilton, and delivered to
him a letter from the leaders of the northern
Royalists. He had likewise undertaken to be the
bearer of despatches to the King, containing the
signatures of the same chieftains; and, having
proceeded to the royal quarters, he obtained an
audience of His Majesty, and explained to him their
past exertions and future plans for his service.
He appears to have been satisfied with his own
reception, and the written answer 'gave great contentment
to all the gentlemen of the north that
stood for the king.'"<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In one of our author's tracts, published in 1652,
we have a pedigree of the family of Urquhart.
Under his own name he states that "he was
knighted by King Charles, in Whitehall Gallery,
in the yeer 1641, the 7 of April." In the same
year he first made his appearance as an author in
the publication of his three books of <i>Epigrams,
Moral and Divine</i>, of which a fuller notice will be
found in a later chapter. Let us now for a little
leave Sir Thomas, happy in his sovereign's favour,
his head encircled with the ivy-wreath that clothes
the brows of learned poets, and his eye fixed upon
a prominent crag of Mount Parnassus as henceforth
specially his own, and turn to his father,
whose golden dreams have long since fled away,
and left him but the dreariest and shabbiest prose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>For thirty-six years the elder Sir Thomas had
been in possession of the ample estates of the
house of Urquhart, and during nearly the whole of
this time the country had been at peace, so that
he had no one but himself to blame for the impoverished
condition in which they were when his
son received them. The latter described the state
of matters in the following terms: "All he bequeathed
unto me, his eldest Son, in matter of
worldly means, was twelve or thirteen thousand
pounds sterling of debt, five brethren all men, and
two sisters almost mariageable, to provide for, and
lesse to defray all this burden with by six hundred
pounds sterling a year, although [<i>i.e.</i> even if] the
warres had not prejudiced me in a farthing, then
[than] what for the maintaining of himself alone in
a peaceable age he inherited for nothing."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>So exasperated was the old man by the importunity
of his creditors, that at last, we are told, the
sound of one of their voices was in his ears as "the
hissing of a basilisk." The great Civil war itself,
which brought calamity and grief to so many
homes, was almost welcomed by him for the
relief it brought him from the "hornings" and
"apprisings," and other legal processes, which
threatened him in times of peace. "The disorderly
troubles of the land," says his son of him,
"being then far advanced, though otherways he disliked
them, were a kind of refreshment to him, and
intermitting relaxation from a more stinging disquietnesse.
For that our intestin troubles and dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>tempers,
by silencing the laws for a while, gave some
repose to those that longed for a breathing time,
and by hudling up the terms of Whitsuntide and
Martimass, which in Scotland are the destinated
times for payment of debts, promiscuously with the
other seasons of the year, were as an oxymel julip
wherewith to indormiat them in a bitter sweet
security."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The most importunate of all the creditors, or,
as Urquhart describes them, "the usurious cormorants,"
who harassed the unhappy proprietor of
Cromartie, was a certain Robert Lesley of Findrassie.
He held a mortgage upon the estate, and though he
was indebted to its owner for many acts of kindness,
he had been the first to foreclose upon the
property, and had persuaded other creditors to join
with him in taking this step. The annoyance and
mortification caused by these proceedings hastened
Sir Thomas's death. Two days before that event,
animated by regret for the wrong he had done his
heir by the impoverishment of the family property,
he assembled his younger children, and bound
them, "under pain of his everlasting curse and
execration," to do all in their power to help their
elder brother. The terms of this extraordinary
bond, his son tells us, were these: "to assist,
concur with, follow, and serve me, to the utmost
of their power, industry, and means, and to spare
neither charge nor travel, though it should cost
them all they had, to release me from the undeserved
bondage of the domineering creditor, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
extricate my lands from the impestrements wherein
they were involved; yea, to bestow nothing of their
owne upon no other use, till that should be done;
and all this under their own handwriting, secured
with the clause of registration to make the opprobrie
the more notorious in case of failing, as the
paper itself, which I have <i>in retentis</i>, together with
another signed to the same sense, by my mother,
and also my brothers and sisters, Dunbugur [Dunlugas]<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
only excepted, will more evidently testifie."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Sir Thomas Urquhart, the elder, died in April [?],
1642, after a long and lingering illness.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>


<p>Our author now returned home to enter on possession
of his estates, and to attempt to reduce to
something like order the chaos in which the family
affairs were. He resolved to commit the management
of his property to trustees, who, after paying
his mother's jointure, were to devote the whole of
the rest of the rents to the reduction of debt. He
himself went to live on the Continent, in the hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
that in a few years he would be able to return
home and enjoy his inheritance unencumbered by
debt. These proceedings, with the disappointing
results that followed them, are related in a passage
of his <i>Logopandecteision</i>, which is worth quoting.
"Immediately after my father's decease," he
says, "for my better expedition in the discharge of
those burthens, having repaired homewards, I did
sequestrate the whole rent (my mother's joynture
excepted) to that use only, and, as I had done
many times before, betook myself to my hazards
abroad, that by vertue of the industry and diligence
of those whom, by the advise and deliberation of
my nearest friends, I was induced to intrust with my
affairs, the debt might be the sooner defrayed, and
the ancient house releeved out of the thraldome it
was so unluckily faln into. But it fell out so far
otherwayes, that after some few years residence
abroad, without any considerable expence from
home, when I thought, because of my having mortified
and set apart all the rent to no other end then
[than] the cutting off and defalking of my father's
debt, that accordingly a great part of my father's
debt had been discharged, I was so far disappointed
of my expectation therin, that whilst, conform to
the confidence reposed in him whom I had intrusted
with my affairs, I hoped to have been exonered
and relieved of many creditors, the debt was only
past over and transferred from one in favours of
another, or rather of many in the favours of one,
who, though he formerly had gained much at my
father's hands, was notwithstanding at the time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
his decease none of his creditors, nor at any time
mine; my Egyptian bondage by such means remaining
still the same, under task masters different only
in name, and the rents neverthelesse taken up to the
full, to my no small detriment and prejudice of the
house standing in my person. The aime of some
of those I concredited [committed] my weightiest
adoes [affairs] unto, being, as is most conspicuously
apparent, that I should never reap the fruition nor
enjoyment of any portion, parcell, or pendicle of
the estate of my predecessors, unlesse by my fortune
and endeavours in forrain countries, I should be
able to acquire as much as might suffice to buy it,
as we say, out of the ground. And verily," he
concludes, "though not in relation to these ignoble
and unworthy by-ends, it was my purpose and
resolution to have done so, which assuredly, had
not the turbulent divisions of the time been such
as to have crossed and thwarted the atchievements
of more faisible projects, I would have
accomplished two or three severall ways ere
now."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>One is inclined to wonder what the two or
three lucrative undertakings were, which this Highland
gentleman had in view when he spoke in this
way of the practicability of making enough money
to purchase back his estates. "What song the
syrens sang," says Sir Thomas Browne, "or what
name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among
women, though puzzling questions are not beyond
all conjecture." But even as wise a man as Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Thomas Browne might well pause before venturing
on a conjecture in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>In one of the official records of the time,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> there
is an entry which shows that Urquhart was resident
in London in 1644. On the 9th May of that
year he is assessed for a forced loan at &pound;1000;
and, on the 16th of the same month, there is an
order for him to be brought up in custody to pay
his assessment; while, on the 21st, it is noted that
his assessment is "respited till he shall speak with
the Scottish committee and take further orders, be
engaging to appear whenever required." He no
doubt proved to the committee that he had no
property in London, but was only a sojourner there,
and was accordingly virtually discharged. His
place of residence in London at this time was
Clare Street,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> then newly erected upon St Clement's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Inn Fields, on the east side of Drury Lane, and
called after John Holles,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> second Earl of Clare,
whose town-house was near by.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Urquhart now resolved to take the
management of his own affairs, and, if possible, so
to conduct matters as to secure subsistence for
himself, as well as satisfaction for his father's
creditors; and, in the year 1645, he went to live
in the ancestral home at Cromartie. His rental
still amounted to &pound;1000 Sterling a year, which
represents about &pound;7000 in our time, but a debt of
twelve or thirteen years' income was a very serious
burden upon such an estate.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the entanglement
in which the financial affairs of the house of
Urquhart were involved became none the less confused
and confusing when the gallant knight applied
himself to unravel it. That was scarcely a task for
which he was fitted. Much more appropriate
would it have been for him to draw the sword, like
Alexander, and cut the Gordian knot. Perhaps his
failure, as in another well-known case,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> is partly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
be attributed to his not having had a legal adviser,
familiar with the intricacies of the law, and able to
prevent his creditors getting more than their pound of
flesh, if not to save even that from them. Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span>
once said that he knew as much law as a gentleman
ought to know. Sir Thomas Urquhart seems to have
had a somewhat similar acquaintance with the same
subject, and this, like that of the person mentioned
in the footnote on the preceding page, was probably
acquired "as a defendant on civil process." There can
be no doubt that he "made an effort" more than once.
In vain did he have recourse to "pecunial charms,
and holy water out of Plutus' cellar."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The charms
were indeed potent, but they were not applied long
enough; the holy water was composed of the right
ingredients, but there was too little of it in the
cellars at Cromartie. He could not, with all his
struggles, succeed in curing what the Limousin
scholar in Rabelais calls "the penury of pecune in
the marsupie" [<i>i.e.</i> the want of money in the purse]&mdash;that
complaint which is so mortifying to the pride
of any gentleman, but which is specially exasperating
to a Highland gentleman. His cares and distresses,
or, as he calls them, his "solicitudinary and
luctiferous discouragements," were enough "to appall
the most undaunted spirits, and kill a very Paphlagonian
partridge, that is said to have two hearts."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p><p>Probably Sir Thomas Urquhart was harshly dealt
with by his father's creditors, though, of course, it is
possible that in the story as told by them they
would appear in a more favourable light. They
had to do with a man who was unpractical and
fantastical in the highest degree, and morbidly
sensitive in all matters that seemed to lower his
dignity or to cast a slur upon his honour. His
brains seethed with plans for the improvement of
agriculture, trade, and education, but none of these
did the importunity of his creditors permit him to
carry into effect. "Truly I may say," he complains,
"that above ten thousand severall times I have by
these flagitators been interrupted for money, which
never came to my use, directly or indirectly one
way or other, at home or abroad, any one time
whereof I was busied about speculations of greater
consequence then [than] all that they were worth
in the world; from which, had I not been violently
pluck'd away by their importunity, I would have
emitted to publick view above five hundred several
treatises on inventions never hitherto thought upon
by any."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Before his imagination there floated the
dream of what he might have been, and his mind
alternated between passionate remonstrances against
his unfortunate circumstances and delusive hopes
and anticipations.</p>

<p>The editor of the Maitland Club edition of
Urquhart's works truly remarks that there is a
melancholy earnestness, almost approaching insanity,
in his wild speculations on what he might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
have done for himself and his country but for the
weight of worldly incumbrances. "Even so," he
says, "may it be said of myself, that when I was
most seriously imbusied about the raising of my
own and countrie's reputation to the supremest
reach of my endeavours, then did my father's
creditors, like so many millstones hanging at my
heels, pull down the vigour of my fancie, and
violently hold that under, what [which] other wayes
would have ascended above the sublimest regions of
vulgar conception."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>So convinced was he that the schemes and inventions
with which his thoughts were occupied
were of immense value, that he declared that he
ought to have the benefit of that Act of James <span class="smcap">III.</span>
(36th statute of his fifth Parliament) which provides
that the debtor's movable goods be first
"valued and discussed before his lands be apprised."
He claimed this as a right from the State; "and
if," he says, "conform to the aforesaid Act, this be
granted, I doe promise shortly to display before the
world, ware of greater value then [than] ever from
the East Indias was brought in ships to Europe."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
But unfortunately the Philistines were too strong
for him.</p>

<p>To these pecuniary difficulties were added annoyances
and wrongs, which the meekest of mankind,
among whom Sir Thomas is not to be reckoned,
would have found it hard to bear.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of Robert Lesley
of Findrassie, the most relentless of all the creditors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
who, according to Sir Thomas Urquhart's account
of matters, made life bitter for him, and defeated his
many schemes for the benefit of the human race.
The injurious proceedings of this man form a subject
which our author can never leave for any
length of time, and to which it is necessary for his
biographer to revert occasionally. His unfortunate
debtor found a certain grim satisfaction, as well as
an opportunity for gratifying his taste for genealogical
research, in tracing Robert's descent from a
celebrated murderer&mdash;that Norman Lesley whose
hands were dipped in the blood of Cardinal Beaton.
It is certain, however, that there was no real
foundation for this opinion.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Unless Robert Lesley is a much-maligned man,
his conduct towards the son of his patron was both
rapacious and ungrateful. On one occasion at least
he acted in a very high-handed manner. "With
all the horse and foot he was able to command,"
says Sir Thomas, "he came in a hostile manner to
take possession of a farm of mine called Ardoch;
unto which ... he had no more just title then
[than] to the town of Jericho mentioned in the
Scriptures; and at the offer of such an indignity to
our house, some of the hot-spirited gentlemen of
our name would even then have taken him, with his
three sons, bound them hand and foot, and thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
them within the flood-mark, into a place called the
Yares of Udol, there to expect the coming of the
sea in a full tide, to carry him along to be seized
in a soil of a greater depth, and abler to restrain the
insatiableness of his immense desires, then [than]
any of my lands within the shire of Cromartie."
Sir Thomas, according to his own account, hindered
the perpetration of this violence, and gave his
enemy and those who accompanied him "a pass and
safe-conduct to their own houses."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Yet so far was the caitiff creditor from being
touched by this proof of magnanimity on the part
of his debtor, that he applied himself with renewed
vigour to the concoction of schemes for his total
destruction. So at least Sir Thomas would have
us believe. On one occasion Lesley tried to inveigle
him to Inverness, with the intention of having him
arrested at the suit of an accomplice&mdash;James
Sutherland, "Tutor of Duffus"&mdash;and kept in durance
until he had satisfied all his enemy's demands.
On another occasion Lesley managed to get a troop
of horse quartered upon the tenants of Cromartie,
till, says our author, "I should transact for a sum,
of money to be paid to his son-in-law; which verily
was the greater part of his portion."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In addition
to this, a garrison was stationed for nearly a year
in the castle of Cromartie, where they conducted
themselves in a way calculated to wound and
humiliate the proud spirit of its proprietor. Among
other wrongs and losses inflicted upon him was
the sequestration of his library, which he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
collected with such pains. Sir Thomas says that
he sought eagerly to be allowed to purchase back
the precious volumes, but was hindered by the
spitefulness and indifference of those to whom he
made application, and was ultimately able to secure
only a few of them, which had been stolen from
the collection and dispersed through the country.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>In an amusing passage in the <i>Logopandecteision</i>,
our author gives us a specimen of the peculiarities
of speech which distinguished his arch-enemy,
Lesley of Findrassie. As we read it we seem to
hear the very tones in which he enunciated or
defended his "felonious little plans." "Several
gentlemen of good account," he says, "and others of
his familiar acquaintance, having many times very
seriously expostulated with him why he did so implacably
demean himself towards me, and with such
irreconciliability of rancor, that nothing could seem
to please him that was consistent with my weal,
his answers most readily were these: 'I have (see
ye?) many daughters (see ye?) to provide portions
for, (see ye?), and that (see ye now?) cannot be done,
(see ye?) without money; the interest (see ye?) of
what I lent, (see ye?), had it been termely [regularly]
payed, (see ye?), would have afforded me (see
ye now?) several stocks for new interests; I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
(see ye?) apprized<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> lands (see ye?) for these summes
(see ye?) borrowed from me, (see ye now?), and
(see ye?) the legal [time] being expired, (see ye
now?), is it not just (see ye?) and equitable (see
ye?) that I have possession (see ye?) of these my
lands, (see ye?), according to my undoubted right,
(see ye now?)?' With these over-words of 'see ye'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and 'see ye now,' as if they had been no less
material then [than] the Psalmist's <i>Selah</i>, and
<i>Higgaion Selah</i>, did he usually nauseate the ears of
his hearers when his tongue was in the career of
uttering anything concerning me; who alwayes
thought that he had very good reason to make use
of such like expressions, 'do you see' and 'do you
see now,' because there being but little candour in
his meaning, whatever he did or spoke was under
some colour."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>It must have been very hard for the proud-hearted
chieftain to see his farms devastated, his
tenants maltreated, his library thrown to the winds,
a garrison placed in his house, and troops of horse
quartered upon his lands without any allowance,
in addition to all the misery and impoverishment
which his father's wastefulness and neglect had
brought down upon his head.</p>

<p>In 1647 an event occurred which seriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
affected the interests of our author, and placed him
in a still more humiliating position. Sir Robert
Farquhar<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> of Mounie had "apprised" the estate
and sheriffship of Cromartie, and was now confirmed
in the possession of them. He proceeded to sell
his rights to (Sir) John Urquhart of Craigfintray,
the great-grandson of the Tutor of Cromartie.
Immediately upon this (Sir) John purchased a commission
from Charles I. to become hereditary Sheriff
of Cromartie. In this way the ancestral domains
and jurisdiction of which Sir Thomas Urquhart was
so proud virtually passed out of his hands. It was
not, however, till after the Restoration apparently
that the new proprietor entered into possession.
He evidently allowed his claims to lie dormant until
the death of his cousin, Sir Thomas, and then put
them in force. Even if our author had no other
troubles to contend with, the knowledge that this
Damoclean sword was suspended above his head
would have been enough to destroy his peace.</p>

<p>No doubt Sir Thomas sometimes thought that he
was the most unlucky chieftain the Urquhart race
had yet known,&mdash;that such a multitude of misfortunes
had never come upon one who bore his
name since that day when, on a sunny plain in
Achaia, wild armed men first raised Esormon "aloft
on the buckler-throne, and with clanging armour
and hearts" hailed him as "fortunate and well-beloved."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Sir Theodore Martin, indeed, says that
Urquhart's statements with regard to his misfortunes
should not be construed to the letter, any more than
should the announcements of his wonderful inventions
and designs. They were both, he considers, in a
great degree pet objects on which he had permitted
his imagination to rest, till they had been transfigured
into a magnitude to which the reality probably bore
but a faint resemblance.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> There is, however, ample
evidence in what we have already quoted, to show that
certain of the grievances he complained of were by
no means imaginary. It is beyond dispute that he
suffered heavily in his property in consequence of
his adherence to the Royalist cause. In 1663 his
brother, Sir Alexander, presented a petition asking
compensation for the losses suffered in the time of
his father and brother. The Commissioners appointed
to examine into these claims reported that,
before 1650, the damage inflicted upon the Urquhart
property amounted to &pound;20,303 Scots, and during
1651-52 to &pound;39,203 Scots&mdash;in all &pound;59,506 Scots,
which is almost &pound;5000 Sterling.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The relations of Sir Thomas Urquhart with the
ministers of the churches of which he was patron
were unfortunately of a painful character. The
grounds of misunderstanding and dispute were
numerous. In addition to political and ecclesi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>astical
differences of opinion between the ministers
of the three parishes<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> (of which Sir Thomas was the
sole heritor) and himself, there were disputes about
augmentation of stipends,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> which they thought inadequate
but with which he had no fault to find,
the abolition of his heritable right to the patronage
of these churches, the legal proceedings taken by the
incumbents to compel him to agree to arrangements
decided upon by the Presbytery with regard to
stipends and the upkeep of buildings, and there were
also personal quarrels with the ministers themselves.
In the following passage he tells his side of the story,
and gives us a vivid, though not an edifying glimpse
of the parochial politics of that far-off time and
remote corner of Scotland. It is to be noticed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that Sir Thomas writes of himself in the third
person. "I think," says the supposed anonymous
writer of him, "there be hardly any in Scotland
that proportionably hath suffered more prejudice by
the Kirk then [than] himself; his own ministers
(to wit, those that preach in the churches whereof
himself is patron, Master Gilbert Anderson, Master
Robert Williamson, and Master Charles Pape by
name, serving the cures of Cromartie, Kirkmichel,
and Cullicudden), having done what lay in them
for the furtherance of their owne covetous ends, to
his utter undoing; for the first of those three, for
no other cause but that the said Sir Thomas would
not authorize the standing of a certain pew (in that
country called a desk), in the church of Cromarty,
put in without his consent by a professed enemy to
his House, who had plotted the ruine thereof, and
one that had no land in the parish, did so rail
against him and his family in the pulpit at several
times, both before his face and in his absence, and
with such opprobrious termes, more like a scolding
tripe-seller's wife then [than] good minister, squirting
the poyson of detraction and abominable falshood
(unfit for the chaire of verity) in the cares
of his tenandry, who were the onely auditors, did
most ingrately and despightfully so calumniate
and revile their master, his own patron and benefactor,
that the scandalous and reproachful words
striving which of them should first discharge against
him its steel-pointed dart, did oftentimes, like
clusters of hemlock or wormewood dipt in vinegar,
stick in his throat; he being almost ready to choak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
with the aconital bitterness and venom thereof, till
the razor of extream passion, by cutting them into
articulate sounds, and very rage it self, in the highest
degree, by procuring a vomit, had made him spue
them out of his mouth into rude, indigested lumps,
like so many toads and vipers that had burst their
gall.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>"As for the other two, notwithstanding that they
had been borne, and their fathers before them,
vassals to his house, and the predecessor of one of
them had shelter in that land, by reason of slaughter
committed by him, when there was no refuge for
him anywhere else in Scotland; and that the other
had never been admitted to any church had it not
been for the favour of his foresaid patron, who,
contrary to the will of his owne friends and great
reluctancy of the ministry it self, was both the
nominater and chuser of him to that function; and
that before his admission he did faithfully protest
he should all the days of his life remain contented
with that competency of portion the late incumbent
in that charge did enjoy before him; they nevertheless
behaved themselves so peevishly and unthankfully
towards their forenamed patron and master,
that, by vertue of an unjust decree, both procured
and purchased from a promiscuous knot of men like
themselves,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> they used all their utmost endeavours,
in absence of their above recited patron, to whom and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
unto whose house they had been so much beholding,
to outlaw him,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and declare him rebel, by open
proclamation at the market-cross of the head town of
his owne shire, in case he did not condescend [consent]
to the grant of that augmentation of stipend
which they demanded, conforme to the tenour of
the above-mentioned decree; the injustice whereof
will appeare when examined by any rational judge.</p>

<p>"Now the best is, when by some moderate gentlemen
it was expostulated, why against their master,
patron, and benefactor, they should have dealt with
such severity and rigour, contrary to all reason and
equity; their answer was, They were inforced and
necessitated so to do by the synodal and presbyterial
conventions of the Kirk, under paine of deprivation,
and expulsion from their benefices: I will not say,
&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#972;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#987; &#954;&#945;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#8032;&#972;&#957; [an evil egg of an evil
crow], but may safely think that a well-sanctified
mother will not have a so ill-instructed brat, and
that <i>injuria humana</i> cannot be the lawfull daughter
of a <i>jure divino</i> parent."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Urquhart is not to be taken as
infallible in the opinions which he formed and
expressed concerning the quality of the sermons
which were delivered from the Presbyterian pulpits
of his time. But there can be no doubt that
he hits upon one great fault by which many of
them were marred&mdash;that of being rather political
harangues than exhortations to godliness after the
Pauline fashion. Indeed, he goes so far as to say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that, as a rule, the preachers of his time seldom
gave such exhortations, as they were "enjoyned by
their ecclesiastical authority [authorities?] to preach
to the times,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> that is, to rail against malignants and
sectaries, or those whom they suppose to be their
enemies."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Preaching "to the times" Sir Thomas
found meant in his neighbourhood preaching against
<i>him</i>; and one may be allowed, it is to be hoped,
without unduly wounding the feelings of those who
admire the Covenanters, to think sympathetically
of his sufferings. Sydney Smith once spoke of a
form of capital punishment in which the victim
was to be "preached to death by wild curates." If
the above description of Mr Gilbert Anderson's

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p><p>But though Sir Thomas Urquhart was a Royalist
in politics, and an Episcopalian in religion, he was
certainly no bigot in his devotion to the King or
the Church. In a passage in <i>The Jewel</i>, he plainly
declares his belief "that there is no government,
whether ecclesiastical or civil, upon earth that is
<i>jure divino</i>, if that divine right be taken in a sense
secluding all other forms of government, save it
alone, from the privilege of that title."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Indeed,
he treats such an idea as merely a pious fraud,
by which despotism is established and maintained
at a very cheap rate over tender consciences by
threatening them with the vengeance of Heaven in
case of disobedience. Such a man was not likely to
be a blind partisan of any cause. Differences in
religious beliefs and practices he attributed to
differences of temperament among individuals, and
to climatic and national peculiarities; and in no
obscure terms he hints that he was of the opinion
of Tamerlane, "who believed that God was best
pleased with diversity of religions, variety of worship,
dissentaneousness of faith, and multiformity
of devotion."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> However powerfully such opinions
may appeal to a certain class of minds, it is hard to
conceive of their being associated with deep religious
feeling; and accordingly we can scarcely be wrong
in concluding that one of the reasons why Sir
Thomas Urquhart held aloof from the Covenanting
movement was that he was at the antipodes to
the majority of his fellow-countrymen in the matter
of religious belief. A certain measure of aversion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
suspicion, and horror is still manifested by many
towards those whose creed is supposed to be of too
limited and negative a character; and we can easily
believe that in the middle of the seventeenth
century this attitude was taken up even more
openly and emphatically. On a later occasion,
when, as we shall relate, Sir Thomas Urquhart
applied to the Commission of the General Assembly
to pardon his having taken part in the capture of
Inverness, his case was referred to the minister of
that town, Mr John Annand, "that he might confer
with him [Sir Thomas] concerning some dangerous
opinions, which, as is informed, he hes sometimes
vented."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In the view of the Commission of
Assembly the guilt of cherishing "dangerous
opinions" was as great as that of rekindling the
flames of civil war, if, indeed, it did not surpass it.</p>

there were in the narrow bounds of Scotland four different armies,

the sword a different cause, namely, the Scottish (Presbyterian)
army under General Lesley, for King and Covenant combined;
the English (Independent) army, under Cromwell, which was

of Turriff parish, Aberdeenshire, near Auchterless Station, and four
and a half miles south-east of Turriff. The castle is supposed to
have been built in 1593. It remained pretty perfect till 1792, was
re-roofed in 1874, and retains a fine baronial hall with vaulted
ceiling. From at least the beginning of the fourteenth century
till 1733, the estate belonged to the Barclays, one of whose line
was the celebrated Russian general, Prince Michael Barclay de
Tolly (1759-1818). In 1792 it was sold to the governors of
Gordon's Hospital, Aberdeen, for &pound;21,000. Towie is a corruption
of Tolly. See Billing's <i>Baronial Antiquities</i>, vol. iv.</p></div>

of 1814, with finely wooded grounds, in Turriff parish, three and a
quarter miles south-east of Turriff. It comprises a considerable
fragment of the ancient baronial castle of Balquholly (Gael. <i>bailecoille</i>,
"town in the wood"), the seat of the Mowats from the
thirteenth century till 1729, when the estate was sold to Alexander
Duff, Esq. Sir Thomas Urquhart must either have rented the
house from the Mowats, or have obtained leave to keep arms
there. The cellars in which the arms were probably kept are
exactly as they were in 1638, except that the old loop-holes are
partly filled up. The name of the mansion was changed to Hatton
Lodge in 1745, and to Hatton Castle in 1814, when the modern part
was built&mdash;Hatton being the name of the property in Auchterless,
which previously belonged to the Duff family. The present proprietor
is Garden Alexander Duff, Esq., who succeeded to the
estates in 1866. There is behind Hatton Castle a small croft
called Cromartie (see Ordnance Map), probably from our author's
occupancy of Balquholly or connexion with it.</p></div>

in 1580 by John Craig, minister of Holyrood House, and subscribed
by James <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and his household on 28th January, 1580-81. It is
printed at length in Row's <i>Historie of the Kirk of Scotland</i>. It
reaffirms the Confession of Faith of 1560, but contains also a
solemn renunciation in great detail of the errors of Popery. It
was approved by the General Assembly in April, 1581. A
"General Band [Bond] for Maintenance of the true Religion" was
added in 1588. The National Covenant of 1637 was an amplification
of the previous Confessions, containing in addition an
abjuration of Episcopal Church-government, as the King's Confession
did of Popery. In September, 1638, Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span> issued a
proclamation for the Scottish people to subscribe this King's Confession
and General Band, but the Covenanters regarded this as a
subtle plot to divide them, and destroy the National Covenant,
and, therefore, protested against the proclamation. The Confession
and Band so subscribed, for it was subscribed by some, got the
name of the "King's Covenant." It did not, of course, contain the
abjuration of Episcopal Church-government. Those who adhered to
it were called Malignants; while the name Covenanters was applied
to those who subscribed the National Covenant.</p></div>

and passages, lined chiefly with butchers' and grocers' shops,
which overflow into the adjacent streets, and are supplemented by
fishmongers and miscellaneous stalls and barrows&mdash;a crowded,
noisy, and unsavoury place on Saturday nights. In 1640,
Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span> granted his licence to Thomas York, his executors, etc.,
to erect as many buildings as they thought proper upon St
Clement's Inn Fields, the inheritance of the Earl of Clare. He
issued another licence in 1642, permitting Gervase Holles, Esq., to
make several streets of the width of thirty, thirty-four, and forty
feet. These streets still retain the names and titles of their
founders&mdash;Clare Street, Denzil Street, and Holles Street. Clare
Street is somewhat rich in interesting associations. There is a
letter of Steele's to his wife, dated from the Bull Head Tavern in
this street, 24th August, 1710. It seems likely that he was hiding
there. Mrs Bracegirdle, a celebrated actress of that time, "was
in the habit of going into that neighbourhood, and giving money
to the poor basket-women, insomuch that she could not pass
without having thankful acclamations from people of all degrees."
It was to Clare Street and Clare Market that Jack Sheppard went,

times refers with great horror, and it may be as well to explain to
our readers what it was, for fortunately it is now a thing of the past.
It was for long the only method of attaching a debtor's heritable
property. By the Act, 1469, c. 36, when payment of a debt could
not be obtained out of the debtor's movables (including rent),
"the King's letters might be obtained, under which a debtor's land
might be sold by the Sheriff to the amount of his debts, and the
creditor paid out of the proceeds. If within six months no purchaser
could be found, a portion of the land equal to the debt was
to be apprised by thirteen men chosen by the sheriff, and the
portion apprised by them was to be made over to the creditor."
The debtor could redeem within seven years. This procedure at
first took place in the head burgh of the shire, where the jury
probably knew enough to make a fair valuation of the land. But
after a time the proceedings often took place in Edinburgh, where the
jury had no special knowledge, and might be packed by the creditor.
So that large estates were sometimes carried off in payment of
trifling debts. The appriser at once entered into possession, and
was not obliged to account for the rents (until 1631, c. 6). It was
thus a powerful engine of oppression. If A. wished B.'s land, and
B. owned land and nothing else, it was possible for A., if he could
only get B. as his debtor even in a small sum, so to work matters
that for the debt he might apprise all B's land. Being then in
right of B.'s rents, he had B. completely in his power, and B. had
no resources for gathering together the amount of the debt which
he must pay in order to redeem his lands within the seven years
allowed. The law was much relaxed by the Act, 1621, c. 6, but the
above will enable us to understand how an unscrupulous creditor
might get an easy-going, thriftless man into his clutches, and impoverish
him and his family.</p></div>

that Lesley's ways were so dark that it was highly necessary for
him often to ask, "See ye?" Yet one cannot help feeling that
this relentless creditor may not have been solely animated by
malignant hatred of his debtor. Even in the above speech there
seem to be claims which cannot be lightly brushed aside. One is
again reminded of Mr Micawber, and of the sudden and unexpected
glimpse of a better nature in his most truculent creditor,
which was vouchsafed him when he got his discharge in bankruptcy.
"Even the revengeful bootmaker," we are told, "declared
in open court that he bore him [Mr M.] no malice, but that
when money was owing to him he liked to be paid. He said he
thought it was human nature" (<i>David Copperfield</i>, chap. xii.).
An eminent American philosopher has said that there is a great
deal of human nature in man. There seems at any rate to have
been a great deal in Mr Lesley of Findrassie.</p></div>

(<i>i.e.</i> stipend-increasing) reminds us of Mr Micawber's
calling his salary his "<i>stipendiary emoluments</i>."</p></div>

<img src="images/s.jpg" width="90" height="99" alt="" title="" />
</div><p>HORTLY after the news of the execution
of Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span> reached Scotland, a rising
on the part of some of the leading
Cavaliers in the north took place, with
the view of restoring the Royal Family.
The most prominent person in this attempt was
Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscardine, a younger brother
of George, the second Earl of Seaforth, who for nearly
ten years past had managed the affairs of the family,
and was looked up to, both on account of his ability
and also on account of the great territorial influence
he represented. He had seen a good deal of service
abroad, and was at one time governor of Stralsund.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Along with him, and only second to him, was our
Sir Thomas Urquhart, to whom even civil war was
scarcely more fraught with anxiety and danger
than was the life he had been forced to lead for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
some time past. Together with them were associated
eight other Royalists of good standing,&mdash;among
whom Colonel Hugh Fraser of Belladrum
and John Munro of Lemlair had a certain pre-eminence,&mdash;and
these ten formed a kind of
revolutionary committee for the control of the
movement they had set on foot, and the government
of the district that might become subject to
them.</p>

<p>Montrose had determined, on hearing of the
execution of the King, to renew the war in Scotland,
but Pluscardine and his associates did not
wait for his arrival. Charles was beheaded on
Tuesday, the 30th of January, 1649, and, by the
22nd of the next month, the Scottish gentlemen in
the north had already taken the field, and captured
Inverness. Four days after, on Monday,
26th February, a meeting of the Committee of War
was held in that town, the minutes of which are
still in existence,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and contain the name of our
author next in order to that of Pluscardine himself.</p>

<p>The Committee passed certain enactments, by
which they took into their own hands the customs
and excise of the six northern counties&mdash;Inverness,
Sutherland, Cromartie, Caithness, Nairn, and Elgin.
An inventory of all the ammunition of the garrison
was ordered to be taken. It was also decided that
Sir Thomas's house at Cromartie should be put in
a state of defence, and that the work should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
carried out by the tenants of Sir James Fraser, a
bitter Parliamentarian, and opponent of the Stuarts
in the north, and by those of our knight's old
enemy, Lesley of Findrassie.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It is easy for unregenerate
human nature to understand the pleasure
with which the members of the Committee of War
would give this last order. By another enactment, the
Committee declare that they consider it expedient
for their safety that the works and forts of Inverness
be demolished and levelled with the ground,
and they ordain that each person appointed to this
work should complete his proportion of it before
eight days have passed, "under pain of being
quartered upon and until the said task be performed."</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March, Mackenzie of Pluscardine,
Sir Thomas Urquhart, and their associates,
were proclaimed as rebels and traitors by the
Estates of Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>&mdash;as "wicked and malignant
persouns intending so far as in thaine lyes, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
their own base ends to lay the foundation of a new
bloodie and unnaturall warre within the bowells of
this their native country," etc. etc.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March the Commissioners of the
General Assembly had written to Pluscardine and
his associates expressing their wonder and grief at
such a rising in the interests of "the Popish,
Prelaticall and Malignant party," and threatening
the penalty of excommunication within ten days if
they would not "desist from and repent of that
horrid insurrection."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The reply to this letter
came in due time, and was signed by the principal
leader in the insurrection, and by some other
members of the Clan Mackenzie, and is, it must
be confessed, a distinctly prevaricating and hypocritical
document. For one sentence at least in it
our author was responsible, though he neither
signs the letter nor is named in it. His pedantic
phraseology reveals his hand in the construction of
the reply to the Commissioners' remonstrances and
threats.</p>

<p>The letter is addressed "to the Honourable and
Right Reverend," and begins as follows:&mdash;"Wee
have lately received yours of the first of Merch,
1649, for the which and your wisdomes Christian
care of ws, and your fatherly admonition to
ws, we humbly and heartily rander yow all
possible thanks." This lamb-like tone is maintained
with admirable gravity all through the epistle, and
is combined with a canting phraseology which was
meant to be impressive, but which must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
entertained any members of the Commission of the
General Assembly who originally possessed and
still retained a sense of humour. "And quheras
[whereas]," so it goes on, "your wisdomes taks it
a matter of no lesse wonder then [than] greife that
we, being vnder the oath of God and tye of our
Nationall Covenant, would make insurrection and
take armes against the Lords people, certainly, if it
were so, we acknowledge your wisdomes had reason
to wonder and to be grieved. And it is no lesse
winder and griefe to ws, being wnder the said
oath and tye of Covenant, furthering the same with
all our power and meanes, and at all occasions
desireing nothing els then [than] the enjoying of
the liberty of the subject, and proprietie of our
goods, intended and promised in and by our Covenant."
No one who has read any of Sir Thomas
Urquhart's original works can doubt that the next
sentence was either composed or revised by him.
The two phrases which we have taken the liberty
of putting into italics could scarcely have occurred
to any other member of the Committee of War.
"Yet we find, that evill willers and envyous vnderminers,
<i>in a singular and pr&#339;textuous way</i> aiming
at our ruine, doe spend <i>the quintessence of their witts</i>
to find out means whereby, under specious pretences
of the publick [good?] to extermine ws with
povertie, and by inventing fresh occasions to make
ws odious, and bring ws vpon fresh stages [<i>sic</i>]
vnder the base name of Malignancy." It is unnecessary
to quote the whole of the letter, but a
couple of sentences, which describe what the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>surgents
had done at Inverness, deserve notice.
"But the whole countrey of all degrees, being
sensible of the oppression and insolency of the
vnnecessary and vnprofitable garison of Innernes to
Church or State, did heartily and vnanimously contribute
to the demolishing thereof, which being
done, all disbanded peaceablie, and the people
retired peaceablie to their owne homes, without
offence to any nighbour of any degree or condition....
And now, when the said garison is dismantled,
we shall be found not only disposed to
live peaceablie, bot also ready to obey all publick
ordours for the good of the Kingdome." The
writers ask that "the taxes and impositions," which
pressed with special severity on the class to which
they belonged, should be remitted, and liberty given
them to lead that religious, peaceful life, to which
both by nature and by deliberate choice, they seem
to say, they were strongly inclined. The sting of
the letter is in its closing words. If these "evill
willers" succeed in persuading the Commissioners
of Assembly to go on with the sentence of excommunication,
as fully deserved, they (the writers)
formally appeal against such a decision from the
Commission to the next General Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The ecclesiastical court to which the above letter
was sent <i>may</i> have contained a goodly sprinkling of
fanatics, but it is certain that in it there were but
few, if any, imbeciles; so that the communication
from the Committee of War did not succeed in
imposing upon those to whom its contents were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
read. They did not condescend to answer it, but
at once issued a pamphlet, entitled <i>A Declaration
and Warning to all Members of this Kirk</i>, "to
recover, if possible, the disturbers of the peace of
God's people out of the snare of Sathan, and to
prevent others from falling therein." The document
displays very genuine indignation and dismay
at the possibility of the negotiations which were
being carried on for restoring Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> as a
"covenanted king" to the throne of his ancestors,
being defeated, and of his coming back as an
arbitrary ruler and oppressor of the Church. Those
who have any doubt about the deterioration of both
religion and politics when they are fused together,
should read this and other State Papers of the
period, and their eyes would be opened. The
calm assumption by the writers that political opponents
are the enemies of God, the claim to
knowledge of the Divine purposes and counsels, the
free use of the most sacred words of Scripture, the
dark fanaticism which inspires so many of the
utterances, and the intense passion which makes so
many of them sound like mere raving&mdash;all combine
to make these documents very painful reading. A
circular letter of warning and exhortation was sent
to Presbyteries, attempts were made to persuade
individuals to disconnect themselves from the
insurrectionary movement, and a message of encouragement
was sent to Lieutenant-General David
Lesley to strengthen his hands in the work of
putting it down by fire and sword.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>The insurgents, after demolishing the fortifications
of Inverness, retired before the troops sent
to suppress them, and took refuge among the
mountains of Ross-shire. Lesley advanced to Fortrose
and garrisoned the castle there, and then
proceeded to endeavour to make terms with the
leaders of the insurrection. The only one who
would listen to no accommodation was Mackenzie
of Pluscardine. Immediately on Lesley's return
south, he descended from the mountains, and attacked
and took the castle of Chanonry. Our Sir
Thomas Urquhart was now safely out of the conflict,
but our readers may wish to know what
became of the insurrectionary movement which he
had such a large share in setting on foot, and from
which he found it prudent to retire at an early stage.</p>

<p>Mackenzie's force was brought up to eight or
nine hundred men by the accession of his nephew,
Lord Reay, with three hundred followers. Soon
afterwards he was joined by General Middleton and
Lord Ogilvie, and advanced into Badenoch, with the
view of raising the people in that and the neighbouring
districts. In what is called the Wardlaw
MS. a very vivid picture is given of the behaviour
of the Highlanders from the Reay country, when
they poured into Inverness on the morning of
Sunday, the 2nd of May, 1649. "They crossed
the bridge of Ness," says the Royalist minister of
Kirkhill, "on the Lord's Day in time of divine
service, and alarmed the people of Inverness, impeding
God's worship in the town. For instead of
bells to ring in to service I saw and heard no other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
than the noise of pipes, drums, pots, pans, kettles,
and spits in the streets to provide them victuals in
every house. And in their quarters the rude rascality
would eat no meat at their tables until the landlord
laid down a shilling Scots upon each trencher,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
calling this '<i>airgiod cagainn</i>' (chewing-money), which
every soldier got, so insolent were they."</p>

<p>The campaign was a very brief one. The
Royalists, joined by the Marquis of Huntly, attacked
and took the castle of Ruthven, but, soon
after, being hardly pressed by Lesley, they turned
southwards and took up their quarters in Balvenie
Castle. General Middleton and Mackenzie were
despatched to treat with Lesley, but before they
reached their destination, the troops from Fortrose,
after a rapid march, surprised the Royalist forces
at Balvenie. A fierce engagement took place, in
which both sides suffered severely.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Eighty of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
insurgents fell in defence of the castle. The Highlanders
were dismissed to their homes on swearing
never again to take up arms against the Parliament;
while their leaders were sent as prisoners to Edinburgh,
where most of them were set free soon
after, on payment of fines, and on giving security
that they would keep the peace. By sharp and
vigorous action the remaining sparks of insurrection
in the north were stamped out, and fresh bodies of
troops were stationed in the principal strongholds
of that part of the country. Thus ended a rising
which would probably have had a very different
result, if it had been postponed until the arrival of
Montrose.</p>

<p>The same writer<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> who gave an account of the
riotous and insolent demeanour of the Highland
soldiers in Inverness, furnishes us with a companion-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>picture&mdash;that
of them on their way back to their
homes after their defeat at Balvenie. It is as
follows:&mdash;"Next twenty horse, and three companies
of foot, were ordered to convey the captives back
over the Spey, and through Moray to Inverness,
where I saw them pass through; and those men
who, in their former march, would hardly eat their
meat without money, are now begging food, and, like
dogs, lap the water which was brought them in tubs
and other vessels in the open streets. Thence they
were conducted over the bridge of Ness, and dismissed
everyone armless and harmless to his own house.
This is a matter of fact which I saw and heard."</p>

<p>The profound feelings of anxiety which this
abortive attempt at insurrection had excited in the
minds of the ecclesiastical rulers of Scotland are
very clearly indicated by the exuberance of joy with
which the tidings of the victory at Balvenie were
received by the Commission of Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> They
instantly decided to appoint a solemn Day of
Thanksgiving, on the 25th of May, for "the Lord's
mercifull defeat of the enemies of the peace of this
land."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> They tacked on a postscript to the above-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>mentioned
<i>Declaration and Warning</i>, containing a
statement of the causes of the Thanksgiving, and
ordered both to be read from all the pulpits in
Scotland. Letters of congratulation were despatched
to the victorious officers, and to others who had
been faithful in the recent crisis, and full particulars
of what had taken place were sent to the Commissioners
of Scotland at the Hague, who were engaged
in the negotiations with "the young man, Charles
Stuart." In the last-mentioned document there is
a flicker of grim humour, as the writers send
intelligence of the destruction of the hopes which
news of the rebellion might have excited in the
minds of Charles and his friends. The last sentence
in the letter can scarcely have been written or
read without a smile. "We have appointed," they
say, "the twenty-fift day of Maij for a solemn
thanksgiving for this and other late mercies, wherewith
we thought good to acquaint yow, that yow
manage this to the best advantage of the work in
your hands, according as yow shall thinke fitt."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
It was once said of a good man that he would have
been better if he had had a little more of the devil
in him; and one is inclined to think more highly of
these good men for the touch of malice, which relieves
the sombre character of their communication.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p><p>The threatened bolt of excommunication was not
launched, but our author found it necessary to apply
to the Commission of General Assembly in order
to make his peace with the ecclesiastical power.
Accordingly, on the 22nd of June, 1650, he
appeared in Edinburgh before this body, and presented
his "supplicatioun" for pardon for the guilt
of taking part in the Northern insurrection, and of
assaulting and razing the walls of Inverness.</p>

<p>The Commission met, doubtless, in that "little
roome of [off] the East Church" of St Giles,
which Baillie describes as having been "verie
handsomelie dressed for our Assemblies in all time
coming,"<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and from which, three years later, the
English officers, under Cromwell's order, ejected the
members of the General Assembly. The Commission
on that day, when our author appeared before
them, consisted of twenty-four members&mdash;the most
distinguished divines and politicians in Scotland of
the Covenanting party. The moderator, or chairman,
was Robert Douglas,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> "a great State preacher,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
who had been chaplain to the Scots troops in the
service of Gustavus Adolphus, and had won the
esteem of that monarch, and who in little more
than six months' time would officiate at the coronation
of Charles II., for whom Sir Thomas Urquhart
had prematurely drawn the sword. Beside him
was Samuel Rutherford, the Principal of St
Andrews, whose fervid piety has found no lack of
admirers in every generation since his time.
Robert Baillie, the writer of the <i>Letters</i> which
contain so many vivid pictures of events in that
stirring period; David Dickson, Professor of Divinity
in Glasgow, whose name we have heard as one of
the deputation to persuade the people of Aberdeen
to take the Covenant; and James Guthrie, who died
as a martyr, the year after the Restoration, were
present there that day. The contrast between
these grave, dignified, saintly Covenanting leaders,
and the brilliant Cavalier, Sir Thomas Urquhart, is
one which, by its picturesqueness, strongly impresses
the imagination.</p>

<p>The Commission, after hearing the petitioner's
statements, did not, apparently; treat the matter as
of very serious moment. The dangerous crisis was
over, and they could afford to be merciful. They
seem to have condoned the political offence, but
referred Sir Thomas to Mr John Annand, minister
of Inverness, one of their number, "that he might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
confer with him concerning some dangerous opinions
which, as was informed, he had sometimes vented."
If these could be explained away, and no further
complicity in disloyal schemes were brought home
to him, Mr Annand was empowered, acting at
all times under the advice of the Presbytery of
Inverness, to receive his public "satisfaction" in
the church of that city. How the matter ended
we do not know. But there is very little doubt
that Sir Thomas's nebulous heterodoxy proved no
bar to his being freed from ecclesiastical censure,
and that, in due course, according to the custom of
that time, he stood, as a penitent, before the
congregation of the Parish Church, in that city the
walls of which he had assisted to assault and overthrow.</p>

<p>A fortnight after Sir Thomas Urquhart's
appearance before the Commission of the General
Assembly, Charles II. landed in Scotland, and was
accepted, though at first not without deep misgivings,
as "covenanted King." The party to which
our author belonged was for a time excluded from
all share in public life; and even the army, which
was to defend the sovereign against the English
sectaries, was carefully sifted, to remove those whose
presence might bring a curse upon it. So that,
though the land resounded with war and the rumour
of war, Sir Thomas remained in an enforced quietude
in his castle at Cromartie. The effect of the battle of
Dunbar (3rd September) was to depress the faction
which had excluded the Royalist partisans from the
army, and kept the King himself in something very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
like bondage. Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span>, indeed, is said to have
given thanks to God for the victory of Cromwell
over the Covenanting forces at this battle, and the
only difficulty in the way of believing this statement
lies in the fact that he so seldom gave thanks for
anything.</p>

<p>The Royalist party now began to rally about
their sovereign. Charles II. was crowned at Scone
on the 1st January, 1651, and in due time an
army, which included many of the so-called
Malignants, was ready for trying conclusions once
again with the terrible English General. And now
for the third time our author took up arms on
behalf of the Stuarts. After some months of
endless marchings and counter-marchings, in which
Cromwell evidently endeavoured to provoke his
enemies into a repetition of the blunder by which
they had lost the battle of Dunbar, the Scottish
forces found an opportunity of marching into
England.</p>

<p>The latter, under David Lesley, had taken up a
strong position on the height of the Tor Wood,
between Stirling and Falkirk, from which they
refused to be drawn out to battle; and Cromwell
resolved to take up his post on the other side of
the Royalist army. Accordingly, he crossed the
Forth at Queensferry, and, after defeating an
attempt to intercept him at Inverkeithing, reached
and occupied Perth. The way to England was
now open, and the Scottish army swiftly and
silently entered upon it, resolved to stake everything
upon a great battle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Urquhart left his castle of Cromartie,
and took part in this expedition, though apparently
he held no position of command in the army, and
was very much out of sympathy with many of
those who journeyed with him. Indeed, his unfortunate
prejudices against the Presbyterian and
Covenanting party come out in the statement he
makes, that many of those who started out to smite
"the Midianites and Philistines," when it came to
the push, managed to make their way home, "being
loth to hazard their precious persons, lest they
should seem to trust to the arm of flesh."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The
mass of those, however, who formed the Scottish
army were of very different mettle, and the battle
in which they staked and lost everything was
one of the fiercest in the whole of the great Civil
War.</p>

<p>The course of their journey southward was
through Biggar and Carlisle, and then through
Lancashire. To their disappointment, they received
no great accession of Royalists, nor of any
others who were inclined to join them in the
attempt to overthrow the Commonwealth. "They
marched," says the historian, "under rigorous
discipline, weary and uncheered, south through
Lancashire; had to dispute ... the Bridge of
Warrington with Lambert and Harrison, who
attended them with horse-troops on the left;
Cromwell with the main army steadily advancing
behind. They carried the Bridge at Warrington;
they summoned various Towns, but none yielded;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
proclaimed their King, with all force of lungs and
heraldry, but none cried, God bless him. Summoning
Shrewsbury, with the usual negative response,
they quitted the London road; bent southward
towards Worcester, a City of slight Garrison and
loyal Mayor; there to entrench themselves, and
repose a little."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Yet but slight opportunity for
this was given them. The course taken by Cromwell
was through York, Nottingham, Coventry, and
Stratford-on-Avon, and when he arrived at Worcester
with his army from Scotland, and with the
county militias, who had risen at his summons, his
forces numbered over thirty thousand men as against
the enemy's sixteen thousand.</p>

<p>Meantime Sir Thomas Urquhart had taken up
his quarters in Worcester, in the house of a Mr
Spilsbury, "a very honest sort of man, who had an
exceeding good woman to his wife." His luggage,
which was stored in an attic, consisted, besides
"scarlet cloaks, buff suits, and arms of all sorts,"
of seven large "portmantles," three of which were
filled with unpublished works in manuscript, and
other valuable documents&mdash;the amount of which
he gives us in quires and quinternions, but which
need not be repeated here. "Peace hath her
victories no less renowned than war," sang Milton
in his sonnet to the Lord General Cromwell;
and perhaps Sir Thomas Urquhart hoped, after
achieving victory in war, to win a second set of
laurels by means of the contents of the three
"portmantles."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>On the evening of the 3rd September, the anniversary
of the battle of Dunbar, and afterwards to
be the date of Cromwell's own death, the battle
of Worcester was fought, and the Royalist cause
utterly shattered. "The fighting of the Scots,"
says Carlyle, "was fierce and desperate. 'My Lord
General did exceedingly hazard himself, riding up
and down in the midst of the fire; riding, himself
in person, to the Enemy's foot to offer them quarter,
whereto they returned no answer but shot.' The
small Scotch Army, begirdled with overpowering
force, and cut off from help or reasonable hope,
storms forth in fiery pulses, horse and foot; charges
now on this side of the River, now on that;&mdash;can on
no side prevail. Cromwell recoils a little, but only
to rally and return irresistible. The small Scotch
Army is, on every side, driven in again. Its fiery
pulsings are but the struggles of death: agonies as
of a lion coiled in the folds of a boa. 'As stiff a
contest,' says Cromwell, 'for four or five hours as
ever I have seen.'"<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The conquered lost six thousand men, and all
their baggage and artillery; and Charles only with
difficulty, and after many romantic adventures, succeeded
in escaping to the Continent when the fight
was over. Ten thousand prisoners, including eleven
of the Scottish nobility, were taken. The sufferings
of many of these brave men were severe in the
extreme. Some perished from want of food and
from gaol diseases, and large numbers of the survivors
were shipped for the plantations, and sold as slaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Urquhart, and, apparently, more than
one of his brothers, were among the prisoners, but
appeared to have fared better than many of their
companions in arms. The greatest of the misfortunes
that fell upon him was, in his estimation, the
sad fate that overtook his precious manuscripts.
The whole story, related in his own inimitable
style, may be read in Chapter VI. It is enough to
say here that a party of marauders broke into his
quarters in search of valuables, that they forced
open the "portmantles" and turned their contents
out upon the floor, and afterwards carried off the
papers to use them for wrapping up articles of
plunder, and for lighting their pipes. Fortunately
some bundles of these papers were afterwards picked
up in the streets and brought back to him, and in
due time found their way to the printer's.</p>

<p>After the battle of Worcester, Sir Thomas
Urquhart and some of the other Scottish gentlemen
who had been taken prisoners there were confined
in the Tower of London. He seems to have
speedily gained the favour of his captors, and to
have been treated with remarkable leniency. Indeed,
he speaks in terms of affectionate respect of various
officers of the Parliamentary army from whom he
had received kindness, and acknowledges courtesies
extended towards him by the Lord General himself.
Thus he places on record his indebtedness to a
"most generous gentleman, Captain Gladmon," for
speaking in his favour to the Protector. And of
another, whom he calls the Marshal-General, in
whose charge he had been placed, he has set down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the praise in the following elaborate sentence:&mdash;"The
kindly usage of the Marshal-General,
Captain Alsop, whilst I was in his custody, I am
bound in duty so to acknowledge, that I may
without dissimulation avouch, for courtesies conferred
on such as were within the verge of his
authority, and fidelity to those by whom he was
intrusted with their tuition [oversight of them] in
that restraint, that never any could by his faithfulness
to the one and loving carriage to the other
bespeak himself more a gentleman, nor in the
discharge of that military place acquit himself
with a more universally-deserved applause and
commendation."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The severity of his imprisonment was soon abated;
and he was removed from the Tower to Windsor
Castle,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and not long after, by the orders of Cromwell,
was paroled <i>de die in diem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The comparative
liberty he now enjoyed enabled him to repair the
loss of his manuscripts after the battle of Worcester,
and he set himself to make the best of the fragments
he had recovered, and to prepare them for
publication, as well as to compose new material.
A paragraph in the Epilogue of one of his works,
in which he describes his warm appreciation of
the measure of freedom he now enjoyed, is worth
quoting. "That I, whilst a prisoner," he says,
"was able to digest and write this Treatise, is an
effect meerly proceeding from the courtesie of my
Lord General Cromwel, by whose recommendation
to the Councel of State my parole being taken for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
my true imprisonment, I was by their favour
enlarged to the extent of the lines of London's
communication; for had I continued as before,
coopt up within walls, or yet been attended still
by a guard, as for a while I was, should the house
of my confinement have never been so pleasant, or
my keepers a very paragon of discretion, and that
the conversation of the best wits in the world,
with affluence of all manner of books, should have
been allowed me for the diversion of my minde, yet
such all antipathie I have to any kinde of restraint
wherein myself is not entrusted, that notwithstanding
these advantages, which to some spirits would
make a jayl seem more delicious then [than]
freedom without them, it could not in that eclipse
of liberty lie in my power to frame myself to the
couching of one sillable, or contriving of a fancie
worthy the labour of putting pen to paper, no more
then [than] a nightingale can warble it in a cage,
or linet in a dungeon."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Another friend whom Sir Thomas Urquhart
found in the time of need was the celebrated
Roger Williams, the apostle of civil and religious
liberty, and the founder of the settlement of Providence,
Rhode Island, and missionary to the
Indians. In the Epilogue to the <i>Logopandecteision</i>
he thus acknowledges his obligations to him: "[I
cannot] forget my thankfulness to that reverend
preacher Mr Roger Williams of Providence, in
New England, for the manifold favours wherein I
stood obliged to him above a whole month before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
either of us had so much as seen other, and that
by his frequent and earnest solicitation in my
behalf of the most especial members both of the
Parliament and Councel of State; in doing whereof
he appeared so truely generous, that when it was
told him how I, having got notice of his so undeserved
respect towards me, was desirous to
embrace some sudden opportunity whereby to
testifie the affection I did owe him, he purposely
delayed the occasion of meeting with me till he
had, as he said, performed some acceptable office
worthy of my acquaintance; in all which, both
before and after we had conversed with one another,
and by those many worthy books set forth by him,
to the advancement of piety and good order, with
some whereof he was pleased to present me, he did
prove himself a man of such discretion and inimitably-sanctified
parts, that an Archangel from heaven
could not have shown more goodness with less
ostentation."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>The years 1652 and 1653 form a period of
astonishing literary activity on the part of our
author, for no fewer than five separate works were
then published by him, two of which were of very
considerable bulk. The motive that had led him to
bring out his two former works&mdash;the <i>Epigrams</i> and
<i>The Trissotetras</i>&mdash;had been a desire to benefit mankind
and to advance the glory of his native land.
But now he had to consider his own interests, and
to exert himself to promote them. Accordingly, his
present aim was to convince his captors of his extraordinary
merits and gifts, and of the incomparable
glory of that family which he had the honour of
representing.</p>

<p>In 1652 he issued his &#928;&#913;&#925;&#932;&#927;&#935;&#929;&#927;&#925;&#927;&#935;&#913;&#925;&#927;&#925;;
<i>or, a Peculiar Promptuary of Time</i>, of
which a detailed description is given in Chapter V.
The object of this treatise is to show the Protector
and the English Parliament that the family of the
Urquharts could be traced back, link by link, to
the red earth out of which Adam was made, and to
suggest how lamentable it would be, if the ruling
power extinguished a race which had successfully
resisted the scythe of Time, and was capable of
rendering great services to the State.</p>

<p>This small treatise was closely followed by a
more important production, upon which Sir Thomas's
fame as an author largely rests&mdash;his &#917;&#922;&#931;&#922;&#933;&#914;&#913;&#923;&#913;&#933;&#929;&#927;&#925;;
<i>or, The Discovery of a most Exquisite
Jewel</i>. The title of this work is intended to be an
abbreviation of a Greek phrase&mdash;"<i>Gold from a
dunghill</i>"&mdash;and contains an allusion to the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the first half of it was, in its manuscript form, one
of the bundles of paper which the soldiers treated
with such disrespect after the battle of Worcester,
and which, indeed, was found next day in a kennel
of one of the streets of that city. This book, a
fuller account of which we give later on, consists
of an introduction to a work on a Universal
Language, to which is added a rhapsodical panegyric
on the Scottish nation, and an account of
his fellow-countrymen who had been famous as
scholars or soldiers during the previous fifty
years.</p>

<p>In the course of the early part of 1652
Urquhart had in some way excited the suspicions
of the Government, and in the month of May his
papers were seized by the authorities. Nothing
treasonable, however, was found among them, and
probably the harmless character of his pursuits,
which was thus brought to light, made a favourable
impression upon the Council of State. For, a few
weeks later, he was allowed, in answer to a petition
which he presented to the Council, and which was
referred to Cromwell, to return to Scotland to
arrange his private affairs, and to be absent for
five months.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The only condition imposed upon
him was that during this time he should do
nothing to the prejudice of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Urquhart's creditors had been told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
that he had been killed at the battle of Worcester,
and, as he says in his own characteristic way,
"for gladness of the tidings [they] had madified
[moistened] their nolls to some purpose with the
liquor of the grape,"<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and had possessed themselves
of all his property. When they were assured by
letters from himself that he was still alive, they
claimed payment for debts which had been long
discharged, under the impression that the receipts
had perished along with other papers after the
battle. They even plotted, we are assured, to
arrest our author in London, after he had been
liberated upon parole. By the thoughtful discretion
of a Captain Goodwin, of Colonel Pride's
regiment, the receipts in question had been saved
out of the spoil of Worcester, and Sir Thomas
Urquhart was able to display them to the unjust
creditors. "And when," he says, "they saw that
those their acquittances ... were produced before
them, they then, looking as if their noses had been
ableeding, could not any longer for shame retard
my cancelling of the aforesaid bonds."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of so many complaints of the
iniquity of creditors, it is gratifying to find Sir
Thomas acknowledging that there was one of that
class who treated him with forbearance and even
with kindness. His thankfulness at discovering
this green oasis in the arid desert in which so much
of his life had been passed, is expressed in his own
characteristic way. "But may," he says, "William
Robertson of Kindeasse, or rather <i>Kindnesse</i> (for so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
they call this worthy man), for his going contrary
to that stream of wickedness which carryeth head-long
his fellow-creditors to the black sea of un-christian-like
dealing, enjoy a long life in this
world, attended with health, wealth, a hopeful
posterity, and all the happiness conducible to
eternal salvation; and may his children after him,
as heires both of his vertues and means, derive
[transmit] his lands and riches to their sons, to
continue successively in that line from generation
to generation, so long as there is a hill in Scotland,
or that the sea doth ebbe and flow. This hearty
wish of mine, as chief of my kinred [kindred], I
bequeath to all that do and are to carry the name
of Urquhart, and adjure them, by the respect they
owe to the stock whence they are descended, for
my father's love and mine to this man, to do all
manner of good offices to each one that bears the
name of Robertson."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>His old enemy, Lesley of Findrassie, endeavoured
in vain to persuade the officers of the English
garrison, then stationed in Urquhart's house at
Cromartie, to arrest him as a prisoner of war, and
keep him in confinement "till he [Lesley] were
contented in all his demands."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> An attempt
was also made to apprehend him at Elgin; but
he escaped all these machinations, and, after
travelling in safety through many of the principal
towns of Scotland, returned to London within the
specified time, and gave himself up to the Council
of State.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>In the course of the year 1653 Sir Thomas
Urquhart published the last of his original works&mdash;his
<i>Logopandecteision</i>, and the translation of the
first two books of Rabelais, in connection with
which his name is best known. The object of the
former of these was to suggest a wonderful scheme
for a universal language, with the idea of being
restored by the Government to the full possession
of his liberty, and of being reinstated in the position
of power and wealth, which he maintained was his
by hereditary right, in order to carry out the
scheme. His hopes and anticipations of success in
this appeal to the English Government were not
daunted by the fact that to do what he required
would need several legislative changes, a reversal of
proceedings in Scottish courts of law, and a substantial
grant from the Treasury. This, after all,
he considered, was a very small price to pay for the
benefits he would thereby confer upon the world.
That the appeal was not successful needs scarcely
be told. Probably in no country in the world,
and at no period in history, could any be found
more likely to turn a deaf ear to such requests,
than such men as Cromwell, Fleetwood, and
Overton. Men like these were too practical, and
of too hard a nature, to be impressed by any such
visionary schemes as those which their prisoner
delighted in constructing.</p>

<p>A veil of obscurity hangs over the closing years
of our author's life. His last appearance before
the public was in the issuing of the books above
mentioned. The only further record of him is in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
continuation of the Pedigree of the Urquharts, which
is contained in the Edinburgh edition of his Tracts.
In this we read that "he was confined for several
years in the Tower of London; from whence he made
his escape, and went beyond seas, where he died
suddenly in a fit of excessive laughter, on being
informed by his servant that the King was restored."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
If this account of matters be true, it would seem
that Sir Thomas had forfeited some of those privileges
which he had won so soon after he had
become a State prisoner. It is quite possible that
this was in consequence of having joined in some
Royalist plot against the Commonwealth and for
the restoration of Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span></p>

<p>In the preface to the second book of Rabelais,
Sir Thomas promises very speedily to translate
the three remaining books of that author, so that
the whole "Pentateuch of Rabelais," as he calls it,
might be in the hands of English readers. But
this design was never completed. The translation
of the third book was found among his papers,
and was published in 1693 by Pierre Antoine
Motteux, but it is probable that the editor himself
had some share in the work as issued to the public.</p>

<p>Sir Theodore Martin considers that there is a
strong presumption against the truth of the above
account of Sir Thomas's death, in his entire silence
during the long period which elapsed between
the publication of his last work and 1660, the date
of the Restoration of Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> "Men," he says,
"so deeply smitten with the <i>caco&euml;thes scribendi</i> as
Urquhart was, do not thus readily cast the pen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
aside; nor was the lack of a publisher likely to
have stood in the way of his literary career. His
writings, if for no other cause but the number of
his friends, must always have been a safe speculation
for a printer, at a time when printing was
cheap and readers numerous. But the imperfect
state of his translation of Rabelais is perhaps the
best evidence of the inaccuracy of the current belief....
Motteux says that Urquhart's version 'was
too kindly received not to encourage him to English
the three remaining books, or at least the third, the
fourth and fifth being in a manner distinct, as
being Pantagruel's voyage. Accordingly he translated
the third book, and would have finished the
whole, had not death prevented him.' This bears
hard against the supposition of that event having
occurred upwards of six years after the two first
books had been given to the world. It is probable
that he died much sooner, a victim in all likelihood
to that fiery restlessness of spirit,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Which o'er-informs its tenement of clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frets the pigmy body to decay.'"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This conjecture is, however, improbable. A
petition from our author's brother, Sir Alexander
Urquhart, is still in existence, in which he asks for
a new commission of hereditary Sheriffship of
Cromartie to be made out for him, on the ground
of his being the eldest surviving son of the Sir
Thomas Urquhart who died in 1642.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Though
this document is undated, it is assigned by the
editor of the volume of State Papers in which it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
to be found, to August of 1660. If this date
be trustworthy, we may be almost sure that the
traditional statement as to the year of our author's
death is correct.</p>

<p>The cause of his giving up his literary labours, and
of omitting to carry through the work of translation
on which he had entered, is, of course, unknown to
us. His health, physical or mental, may have become
seriously impaired, or his spirits may have
been too much depressed by the misfortunes that
crowded upon him, to allow him to engage in
literary work. Indeed, the alleged cause of death
from violent agitation of feeling caused by hearing
of the Restoration of Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span>, argues in itself a
previous condition of great physical weakness.</p>

<p>There seems at first, a certain grotesqueness in
such a fatal exuberance of joy in connexion with
such an event as Charles II. regaining the crown
which his father had lost, and of which in another
generation all of his blood were to be deprived.
But we have to keep in mind that Sir Thomas was
not alone in his folly, if folly it were; for a great
wave of exultation swept over the three kingdoms
at that time. Our author had, like many of his
fellow-Royalists, staked and lost everything he
possessed in the defence of the House of Stuart, and
one can have little difficulty in understanding how
the announcement of the triumph of the cause,
which was so dear to him, should have agitated
him profoundly.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Alexander Urquhart failed to recover possession
of either the barony or the Sheriffship of
Cromartie, and a year after the supposed date of
his petition, he is said to have ratified his cousin's
rights,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and in 1663 he formally "disponed" the
estate (<i>i.e.</i> his title to it) to Sir John.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
possessors were, however, as unfortunate as their
immediate predecessors, for in no very long time
they were overwhelmed by distresses like those
which had burdened and embittered the lives of
our author and his father. In 1682 the celebrated
Sir George Mackenzie, whose name, like that of
Queen Mary of England, is usually associated with
an unenviable epithet, as that of a cruel persecutor,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
"apprized" the estate from Sir John's<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> son, Jonathan.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

to hear that it soon afterwards passed into
his possession. On his elevation to the peerage
(1685) as Viscount Tarbat, first Earl of Cromartie,
he put his third-born son, Sir Kenneth, into possession
of the estate, with the view of establishing a
branch of his family to be known as the Mackenzies
of Cromartie. This plan was doomed to be defeated,
for Sir Kenneth's son George had no family, and
sold the estate to Captain William Urquhart of
Meldrum in 1741.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The lands were again sold to
Patrick, Lord Elibank,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> in 1763, and by him to
George Ross of Pitkerrie, nine years afterwards.
Mr Ross had amassed a large fortune in England
as an army agent,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and part of this he expended in
the purchase of the estate, and in the extensive
improvements which he effected in it. One wishes
he had not thought it desirable to pull down the
picturesque old castle, which had stood on the mote-hill
of Cromartie for three hundred years, and
which had sheltered so many generations of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Urquhart family. Let us now, however, return to
our author.</p>

<p>In telling the story of Sir Thomas Urquhart's
life, some of his most striking peculiarities have
been displayed and illustrated, so that no one who
has read the foregoing pages is altogether dependent
upon what may now be said for forming an estimate
of his character. His vanity is perhaps the most
striking trait in it; but only a very hard-hearted
moralist would call it a vice in his case, for it is as
artless as it is boundless, and is combined with so
much kindness of heart and generosity of feeling,
that we are more entertained by it than indignant
at it. No one who looks into his works can doubt
the intensity of his patriotism. Indeed, his passionate
longing after personal fame is in all cases
combined with the wish to confer additional glory
upon the land of his birth. His devotion to the
Royalist cause<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> is of the purest and most heroic
type, and the general tone of his character, as
revealed to us in his books, is elevated and noble.
At the same time there is an element of the
grotesque in it, so that in his disinterested and
chivalrous disposition he reminds us of Don Quixote,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
while in his frequent allusions to struggles with
pecuniary difficulties, as well as in his use of
magniloquent language, he distinctly recalls Wilkins
Micawber. A lively fancy, a strain of genuine
erudition beneath his pedantry, and some sparks of
insanity, are other elements in his fantastical character.
Only a mind like his own could trace the
maze of its windings and turnings, and fathom
the depths of its eccentricity. In his thoughts
"truth is constantly becoming interfused with
fiction, possibility with certainty, and the hyperbolical
extravagance of his style only keeps even
pace with the prolific shootings of his imagination."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>It is perhaps expected that one should, in a
measure, apologize for the eccentricities of Urquhart's
character and literary style, by explaining that he was
a humourist. But, unfortunately, humour is a quality
in which Urquhart was lacking, unless we understand
by the word mere fantastical quaintness of thought
and speech. In one passage of his works he speaks
with contempt of "shallow-brained humourists,"<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
and we should wrong his ghost by putting him
among those whom he abhorred. Not a single trace
of that subtle, graceful play of fancy and of feeling
which enters into our conception of humour is to be
found in his works.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> His readers may smile as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
turn over his pages, but he is always in deadly earnest.
The quality of wit he occasionally manifests in the
form of keen sarcasm, when he gives full vent to
his feelings of scorn and contempt; as when, for
example, he describes those who went out to fight,
"but did not hazard their precious persons, lest
they should seem to trust to the arm of flesh."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>He can never give a simple statement of matters
of fact. Thus in his account of the Admirable
Crichton, instead of saying that the rector of the
university addressed a few complimentary sentences
to Crichton, and that the latter replied in the same
vein, he says: "In complements after this manner,
<i>ultro citroque habitis</i>, tossed to and again, retorted,
contrerisposted, backreverted, and now and then
graced with a quip or a clinch for the better relish
of the ear, being unwilling in this kind of straining
curtesie to yeeld to other, they spent a full half-hour
and more."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Everything must be dressed up
"with divers quaint and pertinent similes" before it
is fit to be introduced to the reader's notice. To
quote again from the most accomplished literary critic
who has written upon him: "History, philosophy,
science, literature are ransacked for illustrations of
the commonest subject. His fancy is ever on the
alert, and you are constantly surprised by some
incongruous image, begotten in its wanton dalliance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
with knowledge the most heterogeneous. He
has always an eye to effect. His own learning
must be brought into play, rhetorical tropes must
flourish through his periods, 'suggesting to our
minds two several things at once,' and, of course, as
diverse as possible, that 'the spirits of such as are
studious in learning may be filled with a most
wonderful delight.'"<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> His style reacts upon and
controls his thoughts, and often carries him, as
Ariosto's Hippogriff carried Astolfo, up into the
skies, whither those are unable to follow him who
are mounted on humbler animals, or have no other
means than those with which they were born for
plodding along the dusty roads of earth.</p>

<p>If we can trust the two engraved portraits of
Sir Thomas Urquhart which have come down to us,
he was a man of handsome presence, and accustomed
to deck himself in all the splendour of costume to
which so many of his brother-cavaliers were
addicted. George Glover, the famous engraver,
drew both the portraits of him which are extant.
One of these appears as a frontispiece to the
<i>Epigrams</i> and to the <i>Trissotetras</i>. It is a small
whole-length, and represents Sir Thomas in rich
dress,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> holding out his hand to receive from some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
allegorical personage a laurel wreath "for Armes
and Artes."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> On a table beside him are his hat
and embroidered cloak. In the vacant spaces on
each side of the upper part of the figure are his
name and titles: "S^r Thomas Urchard, Knight, of
Bray and Udol, etc., Baron of Ficherie and Clohorby,
etc., Laird Baron of Cromartie and Heritable Sheriff
thereof, etc." The portrait is described as taken
from the life, and engraved in 1641;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and beneath
it is a couplet by W. S., as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of him whose shape this Picture hath design'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vertue and learning represent the Mind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Who W. S. was we do not know. The date forbids
our identifying him with the Bard of Avon. He
was probably one of those mysterious personages,
who were always at hand to write epistles of commendation
to works by Sir Thomas, and to testify
on their "book-oath" to his gifts and graces.</p>

<p>The second engraved portrait is of great rarity,
and only one impression of it is known to be in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>existence. It was probably meant to be a frontispiece
to the unpublished volume of Epigrams
described on p. 116, the title of which was to have
been <i>Apollo and the Muses</i>, but which never found
its way into print. In this engraving Sir Thomas
is depicted as seated with great complacency upon
Mount Parnassus, in the midst of the Muses, seven
of whom are pressing upon his attention wreaths of
laurel of which he is worthy, "for Judgment, Learning,
witt, Invention, sweetness, stile." At his feet
is the sacred fountain of Castalia or Hippocrene,
into the waters of which the other two Muses are
sportively dipping "sprinklers" or asperges. One
of them seems inclined to give Sir Thomas a
sprinkling, but refrains, either because it was
unnecessary or for fear of spoiling his nice clothes.
In the background, the winged horse Pegasus is
flying sufficiently low down to allow a woman to
pluck a couple of feathers from his wings.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
are no doubt intended to provide pens for Sir
Thomas's next literary undertaking. In the further
distance are several feathered creatures, which are
probably meant for poetical swans, but which bear
a painful likeness to prosaic geese. At the foot of
the picture in one corner we have Apollo, playing on
his lyre; and on the ground in front are a half-starved
dragon and a snake, writhing in impotent
rage, as they witness the triumph of Sir Thomas.
We can hardly be mistaken in concluding that
these last are symbolical representations of envious
and carping critics.</p>

victorious generals, Ker, Halket, and Strachan, to the Moderator of
the Commission of Assembly, dated 9th May, 1649. In it they
say: "We were in Innernes vpon Sunday at night, when we
received intelligence that the enemie were come from Torespay to
Balvine, presently to discusse ws (<i>sic</i>). We could not hear from
the Livetennent-Generall [Lesley], and the enemy was making
himselfe strong in many severall quarters in [the] countrie. We
conceived it better to suppresse nor [than] to be suppressed. We
in our weak maner beged the Lords direction, that His blissing
might wait His owne and our labours, and, with great freedome
concluded to march with all expedition to Torispay, intelligence
having come certaine that they were lyeing in Balveine at a wood,
where we engaged with them; and there the Lord delivered them
vnto our hands. We were not abone six score fighting horsemen
and tuelfe muskiteires. We had some more, but they were
wearied. We have at this tyme about 800 prisoners, betuixt
3 or 4 scoir killed, and tuo or thrie hundred fled. My Lord
Rae and all the officers are, according to the capitulatioun,
prisoners; the rest are to be conveyed to their countrey, after we
receive order from the publick; and therefore we shall expect such
further directions from you as you shall thinke fit, for securing
and obliging, by oath, such as shall returne to their countrey"
(<i>General Assembly Commission Records</i>, 1618-49, p. 263). There is a
genuine Cromwellian ring about the phrases "beged the Lord's
direction," and "the Lord delivered them vnto our hands," which
we cannot help admiring; and there is a beauty of its own in the
phrase "with great freedome" in the connection in which it
stands.</p></div>

to his being banished from Massachusetts; and, thereupon, he purchased

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_129_129" id="Footnote_129_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> In the preface to a new translation of Rabelais by W. F. Smith,
Esq., Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, some doubt is cast
upon the above narrative of Sir Thomas's death. Mr Smith
remarks, "This looks something like an imitation of Rabelais in
his account of the death of Philemon." The reference is to the
following passages in Rabelais, who alludes to the story no fewer
than three times. In Book i. 10, we read: "Just so the heart
with excessive joy is inwardly dilated, and suffereth a manifest
resolution of the vital spirits, which may go so farre on, that it
may thereby be deprived of its nourishment, and by consequence
of life itself, by this Pericharie or extremity of gladnesse, as Galen
saith ... and as it hath come to passe in former times ... to
Philemon and others, who died with joy." In chap. xx. some
more particulars are given of the case: "As Philemon, who, for
seeing an asse eate those figs, which were provided for his own
dinner, died with force of laughing." But in Book iv. 17, we are
told the whole story: "[Neither ought you to wonder at] the
death of Philomenes, whose servant, having got him some new
figs for the first course of his dinner, whilst he went to fetch wine,
a straggling ... ass got into the house, and, seeing the figs on
the table, without further invitation, soberly fell to. Philomenes
coming into the room, and nicely observing with what gravity the
ass eat its dinner, said to his man, who was come back, 'Since
thou hast set figs here for this reverend guest of ours to eat,
methinks it is but reason thou also give him some of this wine to
drink.' He had no sooner said this, but he was so excessively
pleased, and fell into so exorbitant a fit of laughter, that the use
of his spleen took that of his breath utterly away, and he immediately
died." The story is taken from Lucian (&#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#953;&#965;&#953;, c. 25)
or from Valerius Maximus (ix. 12), in which in the Paris folio
edition (1517) the name is given as Philomenes. There is undoubtedly
a resemblance between the account of Philemon's death
and that of our author, but we think it can only be accidental.
The editor of the Edinburgh edition of the Tracts is, as I have
said, our only authority for the story of Urquhart's death; but
there is no adequate reason for doubting it. He seems to have
been well versed in the history of the Urquhart family, which he
brings up to date, and must have derived his information from
some members of it. It would be strange if in little more than a
century after our author's death, an utterly mythical account of it
should have sprung up and found a place among the details of
family history. According to Lowndes's <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>,
the editor of the volume was David Herd, the well-known
antiquary. If this statement be correct, we have all the more
reason to rely upon the supplementary information the volume
contains, as Herd's acquaintance with Scottish history and biography
was very extensive and accurate. In one of the <i>Notes
Ambrosian&aelig;</i> (<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, September, 1832), a highly
extravagant version is given of Urquhart's death. It is intended
to be humorous, but is merely flat and silly. Only those can
smile at it who have been trained up to believe that the <i>Notes</i>
contain exquisite humour, and who have, therefore, been accustomed
to welcome passages from it as mirth-inspiring. The statement
made in this mention of Urquhart, that his death was caused
by excessive alcoholic celebration of the happy event of the
Restoration, is utterly baseless and offensive; and it is a pity that in
Allibone's <i>Dictionary</i> and in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
this article in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> should be referred to as one of
the sources of information concerning Urquhart. The author of
it had not access to any other account of Sir Thomas's death than
that given in the above-mentioned edition of the Tracts.</p></div>

received knighthood seems to be approximately fixed by the fact
that in a grant under the Privy Seal of 5th March, 1661, he is called
Alexander, and in a notice of him of the 29th of the same month
and year he appears as Sir Alexander (<i>Acts of Parliament</i>, vii. 93).
From the fact that in this year the succession to the estates and
hereditary Sheriffship of Cromartie were entered upon by his cousin
Sir John Urquhart of Craigfintray, it was taken for granted by the
editor of the Tracts (Edinburgh, 1774) that Sir Alexander had died.
This error is repeated by Hugh Miller, and by most of those who
have made any reference to him. He was still alive in 1667, for
during that year he sold his salmon fishings in Over-rak and the
King's Water to John Gordon (see also <i>Acts of Parliament</i>, vii. 537).
He is spoken of as <i>quondam</i> in a charter of certain lands which had
belonged to him, 19th June, 1668. His cousin, Sir John Urquhart,
received knighthood about the same time; at least he appears in
Parliament as Sir John, 1st January, 1661 (<i>Acts of Parliament</i>, vii. 4).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_133_133" id="Footnote_133_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_133"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> There is said to have been some tragedy in connection with
the death of this Sir John Urquhart. According to Wodrow, as
quoted by Hugh Miller, after having posed as an ultra-Presbyterian,
he became the friend and counsellor of the Earl of Middleton,
Charles II.'s Commissioner for Scotland, under whom Presbyterianism
was overturned and Episcopacy set up in its place (1661).
Tradition says that "about eleven years after the passing of the
Act, he fell into a deep melancholy, and destroyed himself with
his own sword in one of the apartments of the old castle. The
sword, it is said, was flung into a neighbouring draw-well by one
of the domestics, and the stain left by his blood on the walls and
floor of the apartment was distinctly visible at the time the
building was pulled down" (<i>Scenes and Legends of the North of
Scotland</i>, p. 111). Tradition is wrong, however, in saying eleven
years after 1661; for on August 7th, 1677, Sir John, along with
others, received a commission "for putting the laws against conventicles
and other disorders into execution" (<i>Wodrow</i>, ii. p. 366).</p></div>

1741, the shadowy honour of the headship of the family passed to
the Urquharts of Meldrum, who were descended from the Tutor of
Cromartie by a third marriage with Elizabeth Seton, only daughter
of Alexander Seton of Meldrum, and ultimately heiress of that
estate. The last male representative of this line was Major
Beauchamp Colclough Urquhart, who closed a promising career by
a heroic death at the battle of Atbara, in the Sudan, on 8th April,
1898. His sister, Isabel Annie, is wife of Garden Alexander Duff,
Esq., Hatton Castle, Turriff.</p></div>

is a half-length portrait of the translator, evidently reproduced

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_148_148" id="Footnote_148_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148_148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> In this engraving, which is our frontispiece, the Greek inscription
runs thus: &#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#963;&#949; &#960;&#949;&#956;&#968;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#965; &#949;&#953;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#969;, and
means, "<i>I thank those who sent you and gave the order</i>." These
words are, of course, addressed to the messenger who has been
commissioned by the Muses to convey the wreath to Sir Thomas.
Above the wreath itself is an obscure phrase&mdash;M&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#965;[&#956;] &#963;&#964;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#987;&mdash;which
is evidently a mixture of Latin and Greek, musarum &#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#987;
(=&#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#987;?), "<i>messenger of the muses</i>." It may, however, be
that &#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962; is to be taken as "<i>equipment</i>" or "<i>decoration</i>," as
referring to the wreath. The courage with which Greek and Latin
forms are mixed up, and an old word despatched on its way with a
new meaning, of which this brief phrase gives evidence, is highly
characteristic of Cromartian Greek. For further illustration of
the peculiarities of this local variety or Hellenic speech, see p. 149.</p></div>

Sir Thomas Urquhart's <i>Epigrams</i> (MS.):&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Invocation to Clio.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Book 2.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wench wholly martial, to whose inspiration<br /></span>

<p>
The "Colophonian Poet" is&mdash;"not to put too fine a point upon it"&mdash;Homer,
who, according to some, was born at Colophos, in Asia

here, was intended to be a frontispiece to a second volume of
poems. The similarity of diction between this "Invocation" and
the speeches of Ancient Pistol is very great.</p></div>

<h1>CHAPTER IV</h1>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Epigrams: Divine and Moral, and The
Trissotetras</span>
</p>

<div class="figupperleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/i.jpg" width="90" height="116" alt="" title="" />
</div><p>N 1641, Sir Thomas Urquhart published
his first work&mdash;a volume of poems, entitled
"<span class="smcap">Epigrams: Divine and Moral</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
and dedicated to the Marquis of Hamilton.
The poems are divided into three
books, two of which contain forty-five
epigrams, while the third contains forty-four. Most
of them are in iambic pentameters, and are for the
greater part sextets in form; but though the versification
is occasionally smooth, these compositions
do little credit to the Muse who inspired them.
They are, without an exception, pointless; and an
epigram without a point is about as useless
and exasperating as a needle without one.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
somewhat remarkable that in his prose compositions
the imagination of Sir Thomas seems quite unfettered,
while in his poems it is under some such
restraining influence as a strait-waistcoat is said
to exercise upon a certain class of patients.</p>

<p>A wild legend, the origin of which is unknown,
but which is utterly baseless, asserts that Urquhart
"was laureated poet at Paris before he was three
and twenty years of age."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> We could hardly
conceive of any responsible authorities being so far
"left to themselves" as to do a deed like this. The
story may be either the misapplication to Urquhart
of some vague tradition of one of the feats of his
hero, the Admirable Crichton, or of what he himself
has actually recorded of the poet, Arthur Johnston.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>A modern critic, who has given Urquhart a full
measure of praise, finds himself unable to say a
word in favour of his poems. "This slender
volume," he remarks, "gives not the slightest
promise of talent. Its stanzas are indistinguished
and indistinguishable. There is no reason why anyone
should have written them, but, on the other
hand, there is no reason why anyone should not.
They express the usual commonplaces: the inevitableness
of death, and the worth of endeavour. A
mildly Horatian sentiment is dressed up in the
tattered rags of Shakespearianism, and the surprise
is that the author, whose prose is restrained by no
consideration of sound or sense, should have deemed
it worth while to print so tame a collection of
exercises."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>A favourable specimen of the <i>Epigrams</i> is the
following from the first book:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">How Difficult a Thing it is to tread in the Pathes
of Vertue.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The way to vertue's hard, uneasie, bends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft, being full of steep and rugged alleys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For never one to a higher place ascends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That always keeps the plaine, and pleasant valleyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reason in each human breast ordaines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That precious things be purchased with paines."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or take this from the opposite page:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">When a true Friend may be best knowne.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As the glow-worme shines brightest in the darke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frankincense smells sweetest in the fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So crosse adventures make us best remarke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sincere friend from a dissembled lyer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some, being friends to our prosperity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not to us, when it failes, they decay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fault of obscurity, of which the poet
Browning has been accused, could not be laid to
the charge of Sir Thomas Urquhart. Nor can it
be said of him that he neglects truths that are
obvious, and occupies himself in discovering and
bringing forward those that are recondite. The
sentiments to which he gives utterance seem those
which spontaneously occur to the average mind;
on reading the subject of the poem, as given in the
title, and then the poem itself, we think</p>

<p>
"A said whot a owt to 'a said,"<br />
</p>

<p>and we come away without any feverish mental
agitation or accelerated movement of pulse.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p><p>The sentiments which, from his own account,
had, on more occasions than one, filled his mind,
are expressed in the piece entitled "<span class="smcap">The generous
Speech of a Noble Cavallier After he had
disarmed his Adversary at the Single Combat</span>."
They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though with my raper, for the guerdon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your fault deserveth, I may pierce ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your penitence in craving pardon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transpassions my revenge in mercy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wills me both to end this present strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give you leave in peace t' enjoy your life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another Epigram, which one critic regards as
Urquhart's <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i> in this kind of composition.
is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Take <i>man</i> from <i>woman</i>, all that she can show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her own proper, is nought else but <i>wo</i>."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a letter of commendation prefixed to his next
work, <i>The Trissotetras</i>, Sir Thomas Urquhart says of
himself: "This Mathematicall tractate doth no lesse
bespeak him a good Poet and Orator, then [than]
by his elaboured poems he hath showne himselfe
already a good Philosopher and Mathematician."
This self-criticism is all that could be desired. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
work on mathematics that proves an author's
possession of poetical and rhetorical gifts, and a
volume of poetry which leads one to think that
the singer is an accomplished mathematician, are
gifts with which the world is but seldom favoured,
and as it is likely that their merits will not
instantly be observed, the zeal of the author in
calling our attention to them is by no means
unnecessary. But when he goes on to say, still
speaking of himself in the third person, "The Muses
never yet inspired sublimer conceptions in a more
refined stile then [than] is to be found in the accurate
strain of his most ingenious Epigrams," we feel
that he is less felicitous. His first shot has hit the
blank, but the second is wide of the target altogether.</p>

<p>In his dedication of the volume to "the Marquis
of Hamilton, Earle of Arren and Cambridge, etc.,"
he describes its contents as "but flashes of wit." A
modern reader will probably, however, be inclined
to think that this modest opinion of them is far too
flattering. At times there is a faint suggestion of a
possible gleam of brightness, but this is instantly
followed by Egyptian darkness, and one is reminded
of a revolving light that has somehow gone wrong.</p>

<p>The volume closes with the somewhat liturgical
formula, "Here end the first three Bookes of Sir
Thomas Vrchard's Epigrams," and with a doxology,
the latter being almost the only trace of matter in
it to justify the use of "Divine" in the title. The
author was evidently prepared to go on with more
"bookes" of the kind, if he got any encouragement
from publishers or public, but, probably, both
thought it about time for him to stop. The fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
that, in five years after this volume of poems had
appeared, a second edition should apparently have
been brought out, would seem at first to indicate
that there must have been some little run upon the
<i>Epigrams</i>. But the truth of the matter is, that one
"William Leake" had evidently got the "remainder,"
and issued them in 1646 with a new title-page.</p>

<p>In the Introductory Notice to Sir Theodore
Martin's edition of Rabelais, some information is
given concerning a folio volume of unpublished
Epigrams by Urquhart, which is still in existence.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
It consists of ten books, called after Apollo and
the Muses, each containing 110 Epigrams, except
the last, which has 113. The MS. is dedicated to
the Marquis of Hamilton; but, in addition to this,
each book has a separate dedication to some one of
the author's political associates or friends. The
persons thus honoured are the Marquis of Huntly,
the Earl of Arundel, the Earl of Northumberland,
the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Dorset, the
Earl of Holland, the Earl of Newcastle, the Earl of
Stafford, Lord Craven, and Lord Gaurin (Gowran).
According to the custom of that time, the reader
finds his progress barred by several prefaces,
respectively named, in this instance, as the
"Isagoge," or "Introduction," the "Premonition,"
and the "Prolog," and cannot get away without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
"Corollarie," an "Animadversion," several extra
leaves of verses, "A Table for the more easie finding
out of such Epigrams as treat of one subject,"
an "Index," and a "List of proper names."
For one of these latter he has reason to be grateful
to Sir Thomas, for the "Index" is a glossary of
"the harshest and most difficult words contained in
the preceding Epigrams."</p>

<span class="caption">Fac-simile of Sir Thomas Urquhart&#39;s handwriting considerably reduced.</span>
</div>

<p>The general character of the unpublished
Epigrams does not seem to be higher than that of
those which have seen the light of day, and
consequently there is little likelihood of any anxiety
being expressed by the general public for a sight
of them. Some of them also are of a sportive
turn, and are more in accordance with the standard
of taste and manners which prevailed in the middle
of the seventeenth century than with that, of our
own day. From the "Animadversion" it seems
that Urquhart "contryved, blocked, and digested
these eleven hundred epigrams in a thirteen weeks
tyme." This surely breaks the record in the
matter of speed in producing epigrams. Had the
results been better, one would have had more pleasure
in supporting Sir Thomas against all-comers.</p>

<p>The second literary venture made by Sir Thomas
Urquhart was the publication of a scientific work,
entitled "<span class="smcap">The Trissotetras</span>"<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>&mdash;a treatise which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
professed to simplify trigonometry. Yet, notwithstanding
the statement on the title-page that the
new method of working problems in that department
of mathematical science would be found invaluable
by soldiers, sailors, architects, astronomers,
and others, the volume seems to have dropped at
once into the depths of oblivion, without even
having produced a ripple upon the surface of the
waters. No one is known to have read it or to
have been able to read it. Lord Bacon, indeed,
says that things solid and weighty are drowned in
the river of time, while things that are light and
blown-up are carried down by its current.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> A very
comfortable theory would this be for those of us
who write books that are found unreadable and
drop at once out of notice, if only some trustworthy
person could be found who would certify to the
truth of Lord Bacon's assertion.</p>

<p>The editor of the Maitland Club edition of Sir
Thomas Urquhart's Works has some qualms of
conscience about reprinting this treatise. With a
touch of humour, which only true Philistines will
fully appreciate, he says that some apology may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
appear necessary, <i>even to an Antiquarian Club</i>,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> for
reprinting a work apparently so unintelligible and
useless; and accordingly he shelters himself behind
the opinion of Mr Wallace, the Professor of Mathematics
in the University of Edinburgh at that time
(1834). "I have," says Mr Wallace, who had been
asked to examine the work, "looked at Sir Thomas
Urquhart's <i>Trissotetras</i>, but I hardly know what to
think of it. The book is not absolute nonsense, but
is written in a most unintelligible way,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and so as
never book was written before nor since. On this
account it is truly a literary curiosity. There
appears to have been a perverted ingenuity exercised
in writing it, and I imagine that, with some
patience, the author's plan might be understood,
but I doubt if any man would take the trouble; for,
after he had overcome the difficulty, there is nothing
to reward his labour. I presume the object of the
author was to fix the rules of Trigonometry in the
memory, but no writer since his time has adopted
his invention. Indeed, I do not observe the least
mention of his book in the history of mathematical
science. Yet, for his time, he seems not to have
been a bad mathematician. Urquhart speaks in
terms of great praise of Napier, yet not greater
than he deserved. I infer from this that he was
well acquainted with the subject as then known.
The book in question is certainly a <i>curious</i>, if not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
valuable relic of Scottish genius in the olden time,
and it is a good specimen of the pedantry and
fantastic taste of the Author. If, therefore, by reprinting
his works, it be intended to give a true
portraiture of him, <i>The Trissotetras</i> should on that
account, and I see no better reason, again pass
through the press."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The volume is dedicated "To the right honourable
and most noble lady, my dear and loving
mother, the Lady Dowager of Cromartie." The
"Epistle Dedicatory" is couched in the high-flown
language which others would have had difficulty in
concocting, but which seems to flow with ease from
the lips of Sir Thomas. "Thus, Madam," he says,
"unto you doe I totally belong; but so as that
those exteriour parts of mine, which by birth are
from your Ladiship derived, cannot be more fortunate
in this their subjection, notwithstanding the
egregious advantages of bloud and consanguinity
thereby to them accruing, then [than] my selfe am
happy, as from my heart I doe acknowledge it, in
the just right your Ladiship hath to the eternall
possession of the never-dying powers of my soule."
The following passage from the same "Epistle"
reminds one of the adulatory terms in which Sir
Walter Raleigh and Spenser addressed Queen
Elizabeth: "By vertue of your beloved society,
your neighbouring Countesses, and other great
dames of your kindred and acquaintance, become
more illustrious in your imitation [<i>i.e.</i> in imitation
of you]; amidst whom, as Cynthia amongst the
obscurer planets, your Ladiship shines, and darteth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the angelick rayes of your matchlesse example on
the spirits of those who by their good Genius have
been brought into your favourable presence to be
enlightened by them." The concluding passage in
his Dedication is still more remarkable: "I will here,"
he says, "in all submission, most humbly take my
leave of your Ladiship, and beseech Almighty God
that it may please his Divine Majesty so to blesse
your Ladiship with continuance of dayes, that the
sonnes or those whom I have not as yet begot, may
attaine to the happinesse of presenting unto your
Ladiship a braine-babe of more sufficiencie and consequence."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary reader who looks into the volume
cannot fail to be appalled by the new and mysterious
terms with which its pages are crowded. Words
like "proturgetick," "quadrobiquadr&aelig;quation," "sindiforall,"
"eathetobasall," "loxogonosphericall," and
"zetetick," are freely used, and many others equally
hard and thorny. Even the author himself finds
it necessary to append to the work a glossary,
containing an explanation of a number of the
words of which he had made use. "Being certainly
perswaded," he says, "that a great many good spirits
[<i>i.e.</i> worthy souls] ply Trigonometry that are not
versed in the learned tongues, I thought fit for their
encouragement to subjoyne here the explication of
the most important of those Greek and Latin termes,
which for the more efficacy of expression I have
made use of in this Treatise."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>In some cases, however, the "explication," instead
of dispelling the darkness, only renders it more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
visible, as when, <i>e.g.</i>, we are told that "<i>cathetobasall</i>
is said of the concordances of loxogonosphericall
moods, in the datas of the perpendicular and the
base, for finding out of the maine qu&aelig;situm." "<i>Inversionall</i>,"
we are told, "is said of the concordances
of those moods which agree in the manner of their
inversion; that is, in placing the second and fourth
termes of the analogy, together with their indowments,
in the roomes of the first and third, and
contrariwise." Probably only those who are able to
follow the statement that "<i>oppoverticall</i> is said of
those moods which have a catheteuretick concordance
in their datas of the same cathetopposites
and verticall angles," will be qualified to give an
intelligent assent to the statement that "<i>sindiforall</i>
is said of those moods the fourth terme of whose
analogie is onely illatitious to the maine qu&aelig;situm."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Besides the Epistle of Dedication to the author's
mother, there are two Epistles and some Latin
verses addressed to the reader. The former of
these last-mentioned Epistles is signed by Sir
Thomas, and consists of a glowing tribute of respect
to Napier, the inventor of logarithms. "To
write of Trigonometry," he says, "and not make
mention of the illustrious Lord Neper<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> of Marchiston,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the inventer of Logarithms, were to be unmindfull
of him that is our daily benefactor; these artificiall
numbers by him first excogitated and perfected,
being of such incomparable use,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> that by them we
may operate more in one day, and with lesse danger
of errour, then [than] can be done without them in
the space of a whole week; a secret which would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
beene so precious to antiquity that Pythagoras, all
the seven wise men of Greece, Archimedes, Socrates,
Plato, Euclid, and Aristotle, had, if co&aelig;vals, joyntly
adored him, and unanimously concurred to the
deifying of the revealer of so great a mystery." He
concludes with the splendid sentence that Napier's
"immortall fame, in spite of time, will out-last all
ages, and look eternity in the face."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>


<p>The second Epistle to the reader is of a very
startling kind. It professes to be by some one
whose initials are J. A., and it is written in commendation
of the book and its author, but there
can be no doubt that it is the production of Sir
Thomas himself. He could no more disguise his
style of writing than Sir Piercie Shafton could lay
aside his Euphuistic English. After reading the
laudatory sentences bestowed upon the inventor
of logarithms, it is very amusing to find J. A.
remarking of Sir Thomas Urquhart, that "the praise
he hath beene pleased to confer on the learned and
honourable Neper, doth, without any diminution, in
every jot as duly belong unto himselfe."<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> As all our
author's eulogies are constructed on a vast scale, it
is not surprising to read that the new method of
measuring triangles, as compared with the old, is
like the sea-journey between the Pillars of Hercules
("commonly called the Straits of Gibraltar"), as
compared with the land-journey from the one to
the other. In the one case, we have a short voyage
of not more than six hours' sail; in the other case,
a walk of some seven thousand long miles. The
two concluding paragraphs of the Epistle are so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
extraordinary and so characteristic of our author,
that we must be allowed to quote them at length.</p>

<p>"The secret unfolded in the following book," says
J. A., "is so precious, that [the author's] countrey
and kindred would not have been more honoured
by him had he purchased [procured] millions of
gold, and severall rich territories of a great and
vast extent, then [than] for this subtile and divine
invention, which will out-last the continuance of
any inheritance, and remaine fresh in the understandings
of men of profound literature, when
houses and possessions will change their owners,
the wealthy become poor, and the children of the
needy enjoy the treasures of those whose heires are
impoverished. Therefore, seeing for the many-fold
uses thereof in divers arts and sciences, in speculation
and practice, peace and war, sport and earnest,
with the admirable furtherances we reape by it in
the knowledge of sea and land, and heaven and
earth, it cannot be otherwise then [than] permanent,
together with the Author's fame, so long as
any of those endure; I will, God willing, in the
ruines of all these, and when time it selfe is expired,
in testimony of my thankfulnesse in particular for
so great a benefit, if after the resurrection there be
any complementall [complimentary] affability, expresse
myselfe then as I doe now, The Author's most
affectionate, and most humbly devoted servant, J.A."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Why our author should have resorted to this
device for recommending himself and his book, we
cannot tell. Perhaps he felt that some strong
affirmations were needed in the case. Probably he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
agreed with the old saying that, if you wish work
to be thoroughly done, you had better do it yourself.
The moral aspect of the matter we leave in
the hands of our readers for discussion.</p>

<p>In five Latin elegiac couplets of a very neat and
polished kind, Alexander Ross<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> recommends <i>The
Trissotetras</i> to the reader, and assures the author
that Scotia, whom by his writings he was exalting
to the stars, looked down upon him with a benignant
smile. Ross himself is now only known to
most of us from the mention made of him in
<i>Hudibras</i>, in the well-known passage&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was an ancient sage philosopher<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had read Alexander Ross over."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is to be feared that Alexander Ross had not
performed the same feat with regard to Sir Thomas
Urquhart's treatise; for his verses<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
been equally appropriate if the subject of them had
been a flying-machine or a water-tricycle invented
by his friend.</p>

<p>At the end of the glossary in which the hardest
words in <i>The Trissotetras</i> are explained, the author
addresses a word in season to the persons into
whose hands his book may fall. He expects that
"learned and judicious mathematicians" will welcome
it, and he promises them more of the same kind.
His dignified attitude towards carping critics is very
impressive. "But as for such," he says, "who,
either understanding it not, or vain-gloriously being
accustomed to criticise on the works of others, will
presume to carp therein at what they cannot
amend, I pray God to illuminate their judgments
and rectifie their wits, that they may know more
and censure lesse; for so by forbearing detraction,
the venom whereof must needs reflect upon themselves,
they will come to approve better of the
endeavours of those that wish them no harme."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

to understand the title as simply equivalent to "<i>laird</i>." He calls
himself on one of his title-pages <i>Baro Merchistonii</i>, but that phrase

the ordinary render might safely be presumed to know something
about. In these days of higher education for women, it would be
an act of impertinence to provide information on this point for that
class of our readers. The following explanations are, therefore,
intended for those members of the inferior sex whose education on
the mathematical side has been neglected. The idea of logarithms
arose in the mind of Napier from the wish to simplify the processes
of multiplication and division, by making addition and subtraction
take their place. To effect this, connect together a series of
numbers increasing by arithmetical progression with a series
increasing by multiplication or by mathematical progression.</p>

<p>
To multiply, say, 64 by 256, that is to find the products of the
6th and 8th powers of 2, we must take the (6+8)th or 14th power,
which from the table is 16384. To divide 8192 by 256, or the 13th
power of 2 by the 8th, we must take the (13-8)th or 5th power,
which from the table is 32. By means of this principle calculations
can by made by persons whose business it is to do so, and
stored up apart for use. The vast saving to mental labour by this
simple and beautiful adjustment of numbers may be estimated by
a glance at any collection of tables of logarithms. In a science
like astronomy, progress would be terribly impeded if calculations
had to be conducted by the ordinary methods.</p></div>

griffins, in nations of giants and pygmies, and also, of course,
in witches. In short, a pretty accurate statement of his intellectual
creed might be constructed by turning into the articles
of a confession of faith the list of "Vulgar Errors" controverted
by Sir Thomas Browne. It is interesting to know that he was
probably the last person in Scotland who heard the voice of
the water-kelpie. "One day," he says, "travelling before day
with some company near the river Don in Aberdeen, we heard a
great noise and voices calling to us. I was going to answer, but
was forbid by my company, who told me they were spirits, who
never are heard there but before the death of somebody; which
fell out too true, for the next day a gallant gentleman was
drowned, with his horse offering to swim over" (Quoted in

Thomas Urquhart's works is his

A Peculiar PROMPTUARY of
TIME.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> This contains a complete
pedigree of the Urquhart
family from the creation of the world down to the
year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1652. Prefixed to it is a letter to the
reader by "a well-wisher," whose initials are G. P.,
into whose hands the pedigree had fallen by mere
chance, and who had thought himself bound in
duty to the public to see it safely through the
press. According to the statements of this disinterested
philanthropist, the work in question was
but one of a large number of papers of very great
importance, forming part of the author's baggage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
which he had to abandon after the battle of
Worcester. It is the habit, we know, of impecunious
and importunate wayfarers to carry about
with them documents of interest to which they
solicit attention; but why a man in Sir Thomas
Urquhart's position should have gone on a campaign,
encumbered by various unpublished works
in manuscript, it is difficult to say. Perhaps the
simplest explanation is that he was different from
other people.</p>

<p>The soldiers of Cromwell, we were told, made
but light of this portion of the enemy's baggage,
after "the fatal blowe given to the Royal party at
Worcester"; indeed, but for "a surpassing honest
and civil officer of Colonel Pride's regiment," the
pedigree of the Urquharts would have been used
by "a file of musquettiers to afford smoak to their
pipes of tobacco."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The fame of Sir Thomas as an author and as
a soldier moved G. P., as he tells us, to commit this
treatise to the press. With considerable ingenuity
he remarks that, though the author is now in prison
as a Royalist, he understands that his position is
by no means "so desperate as that he thereby will
be much endangered." If any doubt up to this
point existed as to who G. P. might be, it is set at
rest by the terms in which he pleads for favourable
conditions being granted to the prisoner. "It is
humbly desired," he says, "and, as I believe, from
the hearts of all that are acquainted with him, that
the greatest State in the world stain not their glory
by being the Atropos to cut the thred of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
which Saturne's sithe hath not been able to mow in
the progress of all former ages, especially in the
person of him whose inward abilities are like to
produce effects conducible to the State of as long
continuance for the future."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Only Sir Thomas
Urquhart himself had the secret of what we may
call the "spacious" manner of self-eulogy, which by
its very grandeur seems lifted up above all such
petty feelings as pride or vanity.</p>

<p>The concluding passage in the address to the
reader is also worth quoting, as it illustrates the
magnanimous spirit in which the captive deprecates
severity towards himself on the ground of the
injury which would thereby redound to the State.
"Considering," it says, "how formerly he hath been
a M&aelig;cenas to the scholar, a patron to the souldier,
a favourer of the marchant, a protector of the
artificer, and upholder of the yeoman, it were a
thousand pities that by the austerity of a State,
which dependeth in both its <i>esse</i> and <i>bene esse</i> upon
the flourishing of these worthy professions, effects
so advantagious thereto, should, by not conferring
deserved courtesies on him, be extinguished in the
very brood."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>True Pedigree and Lineal Descent of
the Most Ancient and Honourable Family of the
Urquharts in the House of Cromartie</i>, we have a
brief but surprisingly complete history of the family
from the time of Adam<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> down to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1652. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
line runs through the Sethite and not the Cainite
branch of the human race, and, among the sons of
Noah, it passes through Japhet. The story is told
of a marginal note being found in the history of
some ancient Highland family, to the effect that
"about this time the Flood took place." Something
like this is to be found in the document before us,
for, under the date <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 2893, Sir Thomas adds to a
mention of his ancestor Noah, a remark to the
effect that "the Universal Deluge occurred in the
six hundreth yeer compleat of his age."</p>

<p>The good fortune of his ancestors in their inheritances,
marriages, and friendships is very
remarkable. To one of them, Japhet, fell the
inheritance of "all the regions of Europe"; Japhet's
grandson Penuel was "a most intimate friend of
Nimrod, the mighty hunter and builder of Babel";
while his great-grandson Tycheros was chosen by
"Orpah, the daughter of Sabatius Saga, Prince of
the Armenians, to be her husband, because of his
gallantry and good success in the wars."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The name Urquhart came into use at the
comparatively late period of <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 2139, when the
family had been in existence for over eighteen
hundred years. It was first borne by Esormon.
"He," we are told, "was soveraign Prince of Achaia.
For his fortune in the wars, and affability in conversation,
his subjects and familiars surnamed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#962;, that is [to] say, fortunate well-beloved.
After which time, his posterity ever since
hath acknowledged him the father of all that carry
the name of Urquhart.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> He had for his arms, three
banners, three ships, and three ladies, in a field <i>d'or</i>,
with a picture of a young lady above the waste,
holding in her right hand a brandished sword, and
a branch of myrtle in the left, for crest; and for
supporters, two Javanites, after the souldier-habit of
Achaia, with this motto in the scroll of his coat-armour,
&#964;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#945; &#964;&#945; &#964;&#961;&#953;&#945; &#945;&#958;&#953;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#945;&#964;&#945;; that is, These
three are worthy to behold. Upon his wife
Narfesia, who was soveraign of the Amazons, he
begot Cratynter."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The habits of the Urquharts to form alliances
and friendships with persons afterwards famous in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
sacred and secular history is very marked. Thus,
one of them, Phrenedon Urquhart, "was in the
house of the Patriarch Abraham at the time of the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha." At a later
period, another, named Hypsegoras Urquhart, married
a daughter of Herculus Lybius; while a descendant
of theirs, Pamprosodos Urquhart, married Termuth,
"who was that daughter of Pharaoh Amenophis
which found Moses among the bulrushes, and
brought him up as if he had been her own childe."</p>

<p>Another ancestor, Molin Urquhart (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1534),
married Panthea, "the daughter of Deucalion and
Pyrrha, of whom Ovid maketh mention in the first
of his Metamorphoses." The genealogist goes on to
say that "in that part of Africk which, after his
name, is till this hour called Molinea, by cunning
and valour together he killed in one morning three
lions;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> the heads whereof, when in a basket, presented
to his lady Panthea, so terrified her, that
(being quick with childe) for putting her right hand
to her left side, with this sudden exclamation, O
Hercules, what is this? the impression of three
lions' heads was found upon the left side of the
childe as soon as he was born." In consequence of
this incident, the three banners, three ships, and
three ladies in the Urquhart arms were exchanged
for three lions' heads.</p>

<p>A century later, we find that Propetes Urquhart
married Hypermnestra, "the choicest of Danaus' fifty
daughters." This must have been some time
after the little affair happened for which forty-nine
of her sisters were condemned to draw water in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
sieves; for, as every schoolboy knows, the fifty
daughters of Danaus were married to their cousins,
the fifty sons of &AElig;gyptus, and all of them, but one,
at the bidding of their father, murdered their
husbands on the evening of the marriage-day.
Hypermnestra, however, had pity upon her cousin
and husband, Lynceus, and spared him.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> He must
have died shortly after, probably from natural
causes, as it is recorded in the work before us that
she married Propetes Urquhart, and became the
mother of Euplocamos Urquhart.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>The thought of what the family to which
Hypermnestra belonged were capable when their
blood was up, must, one would think, have cast a
slight shadow of apprehension upon the married life
of Propetes Urquhart. A more cheerful tone must
have pervaded that of his descendant Cainotomos
Urquhart, for he, we are told, "took to wife Thymelica,
the daughter of Bacchus, in recompense of
his having accompanied him in the conquest of the
Indies." Further interesting particulars, which are
not elsewhere recorded, are related of this ancestor
of Sir Thomas. On his return from the expedition
in which he assisted Bacchus to conquer India,
he "passed through the territories of Israel, where,
being acquainted with Debora the Judge and Prophetess,
he received from her a very rich jewel,
which afterwards by one of his succession was presented
to Pentasilea, that Queen of the Amazons
that assisted the Trojans against Agamemnon."</p>

<p>Their son Rodrigo Urquhart (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1295) was,
we are told, invited over by his kindred the Clanmolinespick,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
the principal clan in Ireland, and
"bore rule there with much applause and good
success"&mdash;the one solitary instance of the kind, we
suppose, which is to be found in the history of that
"most distressful country." "From him," it is said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
"is descended the Clanrurie,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> of which name there
were twenty-six rulers and kings of Ireland before
the days of Ferguse the first, King of Scots in
Scotland."</p>

<p>A slight degree of uncertainty hangs about the
identity of the wife of Mellessen Urquhart (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
1049). Her name was Nicolia, and before her
marriage she "travelled from the remote Eastern
countries to have experience of the wisdom of
Solomon, and by many<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> is supposed to have been
the Queen of Sheba." Her husband, however, must
have considered that, though she loved wisdom, she
had not acquired much of it, or, at any rate, of the
kind which is needed for bringing up a young
family; for the historian goes on to say that
"Mellessen Urquhart nevertheless sent some of his
children to Ireland and Britain, to be brought up
with the best of his own father and mother's kindred."</p>

<p>Amongst other celebrated persons who had the
honour of being enrolled amongst the ancestors
of Sir Thomas Urquhart are Pothina, a niece of
Lycurgus; &AElig;quanima, the sister of Marcus Coriolanus;
Diosa, the daughter of Alcibiades; and
Tortolina, the daughter of King Arthur. It is
observable that for a good many generations immediately
preceding the author's time, the ladies
who figure in the genealogy are of comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
lowly birth&mdash;seldom, indeed, do they reach the
rank of an earl's daughter. Either the supply of
princesses was by this time somewhat exhausted, or
the demands of the Urquharts were less exorbitant.
The high-spirited character of the most remarkable
scion of the family who drew up the genealogy
forbids us to think that, with the lapse of time, they
had suffered any diminution of courage. It rather
seems as though the world had entered upon a less
heroic stage. Perhaps, like Sir Thomas Browne in
a later age, they had concluded that "it was too
late to be ambitious, for the great mutations of the
world were acted."</p>

<p>In the time of Vocompos (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 775) a further
change took place in the arms of the Urquharts,
which gave them their final form. "Vocompos,"
we learn, "was the first in the world that had the
bears' heads to his arms, being induced to exchange,
by the instigation of King Solvatius, his arms of
three lions' heads, for the three bears' heads, razed,
because of the great exploit, in presence of the
King, done by him and his two brothers, in killing,
one morning, three wild bears, in the Caledonian
forrest: the supporters were also changed into two
greyhounds: the crest and impress remaining still
the same as it was since the days of Astioremon."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>An alleged ancestor of our author, William de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Monte Alto (Mouat),<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> took part in the patriotic
resistance of Scotland against English oppression
which is associated with the names of Bruce and
Wallace, and the faint local traditions of that time
partly corroborate Urquhart's statements. "This
William," he says, "caried himself so lovingly
towards King Robert, that when almost all Scotland
was possest by King Edward's faction, and his lands
at Cromartie altogether overrun by them, and his
house garrisoned and victualed with three yeers
provision of all necessaries for one hundred men, he
by a stratagem gained the castle, and with the
matter of fourty men, keept it out against the forces
of Edward for the space of seven yeers and a half,
during which time all his lands there were totally
wasted, and his woods burnt; so that, having
nothing then he could properly call his own but
the mote-hill onely of Cromartie, which he fiercely
maintained against the enemies, he was agnamed
<i>Gulielmus de Monte Alto</i>. At last William Wallace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
came to his relief, but, as I conceive, it was the
brother's son of the renowned William, who in a
little den [or hollow] within two miles of Cromartie,
till this hour called Wallace Den, killed six hundred
of King Edward's unfortunate forces. Afterwards,
raising the siege from about the mote-hill of
Cromartie by the assistance of his namesake the
other William, the shire of Cromarty was totally
purged of the enemy."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Tradition, according to Hugh Miller, is silent
respecting the siege, but relates many details of
the battle. The Scottish forces lay in ambuscade
in the ravine or hollow which is still, or was until
recently, called by Wallace's name, and attacked a
large body of English troops on their way to join
some of their countrymen, who were encamped on
the peninsula of Easter Ross. The English were
surprised and panic-struck, and left six hundred
dead on the field of battle. The survivors were
unacquainted with the country, and were under the
impression that there was continuous land between

"They were only undeceived," we are told, "when,
on climbing the southern Sutor, where it rises
behind the town, they saw an arm of the sea more
than a mile in width, and skirted by abrupt and
dizzy precipices, opening before them. The spot is
still pointed out where they made their final stand;
and a few shapeless hillocks, that may still be
seen among the trees, are said to have been raised
above the bodies of those who fell; while the

position, were either driven over the neighbouring
precipices, or perished amidst the waves of the

<p>Sir Thomas does not let us off easily. After
subjecting our credulity to a severe strain by one
kind of statement, he unexpectedly increases the
tension by another. Thus he says that an ancestor
in the fifteenth century, Thomas Urquhart, had by
his wife Helen Abernethie, daughter of Lord Salton,
five-and-twenty sons, who grew up to manhood,
and eleven daughters, all of whom found husbands.
It would only have been kind of him to have
reduced these numbers a little. But on one point
he has spared us: we are not asked to believe that
there were others who died in infancy.</p>

<p>In a postscript Sir Thomas Urquhart explains
that he has just given his readers a sketch of the
history of his family, but hopes to furnish them
with a complete narrative as soon as he obtains his
release from his parole, and is at liberty to attend
to this and to other matters of greater importance.
The thought of the delightful book in store for
mankind is so attractive to him that he cannot
help dilating upon it. "In the great chronicle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the House of Urquhart," he continues, "the aforesaid
Sir Thomas purposeth, by God's assistance, to
make mention of the illustrious families from thence
descended, which as yet are in esteem in the
countries of Germany, Bohemia, Italy, France, Spain,
England, Scotland, Ireland, and several other nations
of a warmer climate, adjacent to that famous territory
of Greece, the lovely mother of this most
ancient and honourable stem."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> He also intends
not to omit the name of any family with which at
any time the aforesaid house has contracted alliance.</p>

<p>The concluding paragraph is very amusing; for
in it our author promises to give proof of the statements
he has made, by quoting from the works
of respectable chroniclers of past ages, though the
degree of certainty which the reader may thereby
expect to reach falls short of that given by Holy
writ or the works of Euclid. "And finally," he
says, "for confirmation of the truth in deriving of
his extraction from the Ionian race of the Prince of
Achaia, and in the deduction of all the considerable
particulars of the whole story, [the author] is resolved
to produce testimonies of Arabick, Greek, Latin, and
other writers of such authentick approbation, that
we may boldly from thence infer consequences of
no less infallible verity then [than] any that is not
grounded on faith by means of a Divine illumination,
as is the story of the Bible, or on reason, by
vertue of the unavoidable inference of a necessary
concluding demonstration, as that of the Elements
of Euclid; which being the greatest evidence that
in any narration of that kinde is to be expected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the judicious reader is bid farewel, from whom
the Author for the time most humbly takes his
leave."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>It is needless to say that the scheme of filling
out the sketch of the history of the Urquhart
family was never carried out, if ever it had been
seriously entertained by Sir Thomas; and we are
left in ignorance of the names of the Arabic, Greek,
Latin, and other authors on whose testimony our
belief in the authenticity of the narrative was to
have been firmly based. In the absence of this
our judgment is left in suspense, unless, indeed,
we conclude that, as the genealogy begins and ends
with the names of actual persons,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> the intermediate
part is not likely to have been a mere fabrication.
If the links are sound in the places where we can
test them, it requires no very great exercise of
credulity to believe that they are the same
throughout.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold on one occasion laid down the
principle, that a book should either "edify the
uninstructed," or "inform the instructed." Sir
Thomas Urquhart's "&#928;&#913;&#925;&#932;&#927;&#935;&#929;&#927;&#925;&#927;&#935;&#913;&#925;&#927;&#925;"
certainly justifies its existence according to this
standard of judging literature; for if it does not
serve to edify the uninstructed, it <i>does</i> inform the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
instructed, since the information it contains is not
to be found in any other quarter.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>One's faith in the credibility of his narrative is,
however, a little shaken by finding that in the
second book of his favourite author, Rabelais, the
genealogy of the giant Pantagruel is carried up to
a period far beyond the Flood. It may be a mere
coincidence, but it is one of those coincidences that
make us very thoughtful.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>At the time when Sir Thomas Urquhart wrote,
Scotland was supposed to have had a dynasty of
kings and a connected political history dating far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
back before the birth of Christ. The impudent
fictions of Hector Boece, whose history of Scotland
was published in 1526, had been accepted by the
public, and were regarded as genuine facts even by
such literary personages as Erasmus and Paulus
Jovius. Perhaps Sir Thomas thought that a
credulity which had endured the considerable strain
which Boece had put upon it might be trusted to
bear a still greater weight. Indeed, he interwove
the story of his family with that which was current
as the genuine history of his native land.</p>

<p>According to the mythical history of Scotland,
Gathelus, a Grecian prince, having quarrelled with
his father Miol, took refuge in Egypt, and married
Scota, a daughter of the Pharaoh who perished in
the Red Sea. The young people came west and
founded Portugal (<i>i.e.</i> Port of Gathelus), and then
journeyed north to Scotland, bringing with them, as
part of their baggage, the coronation-stone yet to
be seen in Westminster Abbey. Their descendant
Fergus, "the father of a hundred kings," was the
founder of the Scottish monarchy. These shadowy
persons appear again, "with the moonlight streaming
through them," and play their parts in the
genealogy of the Urquharts.</p>

<p>Some have thought that Sir Thomas believed
devoutly in the genealogy himself, and was the dupe
of his own imagination. One would be sorry to
form so low an opinion of his mental endowments.
If the book in question were not an elaborate joke,
it can only have been intended to impose upon the
English people by convincing them of the extraordinary
dignity and grandeur of their captive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
If this were indeed the case, he must have had an
humbler opinion of the intellectual faculties possessed
by the average Englishman than even the
majority of his fellow-countrymen entertain.</p>

<p>A very amusing reference to this book of Sir
Thomas Urquhart's is to be found in the Decisions
of the Court of Session, under date of 23rd to 25th
January, 1706.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> In that year an action was
brought by the Earl of Sutherland against the Earls
of Crawford, Errol, and Marischal, to determine the
question of precedency in the rolls of Parliament.
The pursuer asserted that he was lineally descended
from an Earl of Sutherland living in 1275, while
his opponents' ancestors were not Earls till about
1399. The pursuer laid stress upon the fact that,
in 1630, a formal inquiry into this matter had
been held at Inverness, and that the decision had
been in his favour. The persons who conducted
the inquiry were, he said, of undoubted credit, and
well versed in the particulars investigated, and
"might have had good information from old men
and writs, which in the course of time and through
accidents had long disappeared." The advocate for
the defenders replied that the "Chancellor of the
Inquest" had been Sir Thomas Urquhart, who
might have traced the pursuer's descent from Noah,
as he had deduced his own genealogy from Adam,
and that the decision arrived at was of no more
value than "his fanciful derivation of his own
pedigree. For the members of the Inquest seemed
to have sworn rashly upon matters of greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
antiquity than they could certainly know." "It is
true," was the pursuer's reply, "the defender in his
gaiety objects against Sir Thomas Urquhart as an
ill genealogist; and it is owned that his derivation
from Adam and Noah was fantastic enough, and
indeed but <i>lusus ingenii</i>; but, after all, the
defender's criticism will not hinder him to pass
for a most knowing gentleman." The case was
decided in favour of the Earl of Sutherland, so far
as some of his contentions were concerned. But it
is somewhat curious that his advocate overlooked
the fact that the Sir Thomas Urquhart of 1630,
who had been the "Chancellor of the Inquest," was
not the author of the book containing the genealogy
of the Urquharts, but that it was written by his
son. It is quite possible, however, that it was a
matter of notoriety that the elder Sir Thomas had
been a believer in the long pedigree which his
more famous son had, years after, elaborated and
published.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

The late Charles Darwin carried back the pedigree of man a
prodigious length, though he lowered its quality. There can be
little doubt that our author would have disdained to accept what
used to be called "the lower animals" as, in any sense, ancestors
of mankind, or, at any rate, of the dignified family of Urquhart.</p></div>

Charles Lamb once lent a volume of the old dramatists to a friend,
and asked him his opinion of it. The reply was that it contained
a considerable amount of bad spelling! The name Urquhart, as
thus written, occurs here in Sir Thomas's "Pedigree," and is,
doubtless, the correct form of the name. In the Latinised shape
of Urquhardus it occurs on the register of the University of Aberdeen,
at which our author studied. Yet Urchard seems to have
been

<p>
The unbridled licence in the matter of spelling prevalent at that
period is still further illustrated by the historian Gordon, who
wrote the <i>History of Scots Affairs</i>, and who gives us the name in
the form of Wrqhward! This, one would think, was as far as it
was possible to get in the way of bad spelling, without altogether
taking leave of the sounds to be expressed by alphabetical signs.
After it the spelling Wrwhart, as we find it in an Act of Parliament
of 1663, seems rather poor.</p></div>

Her sad forebodings concerning her own fate, it is satisfactory to

The word "<i>maol</i>," "a tonsured servant," occurs in Malise (<i>maol-Josa</i>),

a representation of the Urquhart coat of arms, such as it was in
Sir Thomas's own time. It was no doubt executed at his orders
and under his direction, for inscribed on it are the names of some
of those worthies who appear in the above genealogical history.
The representation which we give of this stone is from a photograph
specially taken for the illustration of this work. As the porch in
the wall of which the slab is set is very narrow, it was impossible,
even with the use of a wide-angle lens, to get a more satisfactory
photograph than that which is here reproduced. Our
readers will therefore kindly excuse the distortion of shape
which is only too apparent, and accept as a measure of compensation
the vividness with which the details of the engraved
stone are brought out. "This singular relic," says Hugh
Miller, "which has, perhaps, more of character impressed upon it
than any other piece of sandstone in the kingdom, is about five
feet in length by three in breadth, and bears date <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> 5612,
<span class="smcap">A.C.</span> 1651. On the lower and upper edges it is bordered by a plain
moulding, and at the ends by belts of rich foliage, terminating in
a chalice or vase. In the upper corner two knights in complete
armour on horseback, and with their lances couched, front each
other, as if in the tilt-yard. Two Sirens playing on harps occupy the
lower. In the centre are the arms&mdash;the charge on the shield three
bears' heads, the supporters two greyhounds leashed and collared,
the crest a naked woman holding a dagger and palm, the helmet
that of a knight, with the beaver partially raised, and so profusely
mantled that the drapery occupies more space than the shield and
supporters, and the motto <span class="smcap">Meane Weil, Speak Weil, and Do
Weil</span>. Sir Thomas's initials, S. T. V. C., are placed separately,
one letter at the outer side of each supporter, one in the centre of
the crest, and one beneath the label; while the names of the more
celebrated heroes of his genealogy, and the eras in which they
flourished, occupy in the following inscription the space between
the figures:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Anno Astioremonis</span>, 2226; <span class="smcap">Anno Vocompotis</span>,
3892; <span class="smcap">Anno Molini</span>, 3199; <span class="smcap">Anno Rodrici</span>, 2958; <span class="smcap">Anno Chari</span>,
2219; <span class="smcap">Anno Lutorci</span>, 2000; <span class="smcap">Anno Esormonis</span>, 3804. It is
melancholy enough that this singular exhibition of family pride
should have been made in the same year in which the family received
its deathblow&mdash;the year of Worcester battle" (<i>Scenes and
Legends of the North of Scotland</i>, chap. vii.). The arms of the
Urquhart family in their later form, as associated with those of the
Meldrum and Seton families, are given in the 1774 edition of the
&#928;&#913;&#925;&#932;&#927;&#935;&#929;&#927;&#925;&#927;&#935;&#913;&#925;&#927;&#925;, and are as follows:&mdash;"<i>Arms</i>, Or, three
Bears-heads, erazed, gules, langued azure. <i>Crest</i>, a demy Otter
issuing from the wreath sable, crowned with an antique Crown, or,
holding betwixt his paws a crescent gules. <i>Motto</i> above, <i>Per mare
et Terras</i>, and below, <i>Mean, speak, and do well</i>. <i>Supporters</i>, two
grayhounds, proper collared gules, and leashed." There can be no
doubt that the Urquhart arms should be the three <i>bears'</i> heads,
though they are often described as three <i>boars'</i> heads. The records
of 1742 and 1760 in the Lyon Register make this quite certain.
Probably the close resemblance between the two words is the principal
cause of the confusion with regard to the matter which exists.
In the sculptured coat of arms, of which we give a representation,
the heads certainly have a superficial resemblance at least to those
of boars. A correspondent who takes an interest in this question
remarks, however, that "though the heads have tusks worthy of
any boar, they (<i>i.e.</i> the heads) are set at right angles to the necks
in a way in which no boar could be represented." On the other
hand, the snouts of the animals have that distinctly <i>retrouss&eacute;</i>
shape which we associate with pigs, both wild and domesticated.
The question is, therefore, not so simple as at first sight it appears,
and can scarcely be adequately dealt with in a mere footnote.
Accordingly we leave our readers to discuss and settle the difficulty.</p></div>

by the first generation of readers it would be received with scoffs,
that the second generation would have their doubts about it, but that
the third generation would be heavily inclined to believe it. Time
has moved somewhat more slowly, however, than he anticipated,
and probably but few of us have as yet got past the second stage.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_196_196" id="Footnote_196_196"></a><a href="#FNanchor_196_196"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> In the article on Crichton in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, Dr
Kippis subjects our author to grave censure (see p. 158). With
respect to Urquhart's present work he says: "Of his total disregard
to truth there is incontestible evidence in another work
of his, entitled <i>The True Pedigree</i>, etc. In this work it is almost
incredible what a number of falsities he has invented, both with
respect to names and facts. Perhaps a more flagrant instance of
imposture and fiction was never exhibited; and the absurdity of
the whole pedigree is beyond the power of words to express. It
can only be felt by those who have perused the Tract itself." It
is to be feared that Dr Kippis was mentally akin to the Irish
bishop who remarked of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> when it appeared, that
"all was not gospel that was in that book."
</p><p>
Some one has said that the names of Urquhart's ancestors, at any
rate on the male side, are very likely those of the giants and heathen
in the <i>Amadis of Gaul</i>; and certainly Famongomadan, Cartadaque,
Madanfabul, Arcalaus, and Basagante remind one of chiefs and
heroes of the Cromartie line. In the female line the resemblance
is much closer; for Asymbleta, Eromena, and Gonima distinctly
recall the Darioleta, Brisena, and Madasima of the romance.</p></div>

and undignified monarch, James VI., from whom he received
knighthood. Both were the first Protestants of their respective
houses, both were attached to prelacy rather than to Presbyterianism,
and both were wasteful and slovenly in money matters. If
the above conjecture be well founded, they had a further point of
resemblance to each other, in their interest in fabulous genealogies.
And it may be said of them both that they prepared a series of
misfortunes for their chivalrous, high-spirited sons.</p></div>

</div><p>IR Thomas Urquhart's previous
excursions into literature had been
of a somewhat tentative kind, and
calculated to whet the desire of a
judicious reader for him to enter upon
more serious undertakings. He had appeared in the
world of letters in several different aspects,&mdash;as
a man of science, and as the representative and
poet, as historian of a family which, for long descent
and glorious achievements, could not be rivalled, if his
statements concerning it were to be credited,&mdash;but
no one could forecast, from what he had already
published, the nature of his next literary exploit.</p>

<p>The volume which followed the Pedigree of the
Urquharts has the strange name above printed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
but most of those who have occasion to mention it
more than once find it more convenient to call it
"The Jewel."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Its contents are of such a character
that one who had read it carefully would find it
difficult to state off-hand or in a single sentence
what they were. A Scottish Divinity professor of
somewhat erratic habits began, on one occasion, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
lecture in which he was to deal with several miscellaneous
items, with the words, "Gentlemen, my
subject to-day will be hotch-potch." This is an
exact description of <i>The Jewel</i>, and those to whom
nature has given the mental apparatus needed for
appreciating Sir Thomas Urquhart will rejoice and
not repine at the fact that the feeding laid before
them is of a confused character. Accordingly no
logical sequence will be allowed to mar the symmetry
of this chapter in which <i>The Jewel</i> is
described.</p>

<p>The main contents of the work are lists of the
ancestors, male and female, of the Urquhart family
from the beginning down to the year 1652, taken
from the Pedigree; a narrative of the sad fate that
overtook the author's manuscripts after the battle
of Worcester; some pages of one of them which
contained a scheme for a Universal Language; a
denunciation of the "unjust usurpation of the
Presbyterian Clergy, and the judaical practices of
some merchants" by which discredit had been cast
upon the Scottish name; an account of Scotsmen
famous for martial exploits or for learning during
the previous half-century; a statement of personal
wrongs inflicted upon the author by ministers of
his own parishes; arguments in favour of the union
of Scotland and England; and apologies for the
simple and unadorned strain in which the work is
written. All through the volume Sir Thomas is
spoken of in the third person, and the signature of
"Christianus Presbyteromastix" is attached to the
preface, or "the Epistle Liminary," as it is called,
but there is scarcely any attempt made to keep up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the pretence of anonymity. The object of the
writer is to try to obtain for the prisoner of war
restoration to complete liberty and the enjoyment
of his property, and he seeks to correct the evil
impression, which the conduct of certain persons
in Scotland had produced upon the English people,
by narrating the martial and literary achievements
of more worthy representatives of his
nation.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the work had been
produced is described by the writer in the following
terms. "Laying aside all other businesses," he
says, "and cooping my self up daily for some hours
together, betwixt the case and the printing press, I
usually afforded the setter copy at the rate of above
a whole printed sheet in the day; which, although
by reason of the smallness of a Pica letter, and close
couching thereof, it did amount to three full sheets
of my writing; the aforesaid setter, nevertheless (so
nimble a workman he was), would in the space of
twenty-four hours make dispatch of the whole, and
be ready for another sheet. He and I striving thus
who should compose fastest, he with his hand, and
I with my brain; and his uncasing of the letters,
and placing them in the composing instrument,
standing for my conception; and his plenishing of
the gally, and imposing of the form, encountering
with the supposed equi-value of my writing, we
would almost every foot or so jump together in
this joynt expedition, and so neerly overtake
other in our intended course, that I was oftentimes,
(to keep him doing), glad to tear off parcels of ten or
twelve lines apeece, and give him them, till more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
were ready;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> unto which he would so suddenly put
an order, that almost still, before the ink of the
written letters was dry, their representatives were,
(out of their respective boxes), ranked in the composing-stick;
by means of which great haste, I writing
but upon the loose sheets of cording-quires, which, as
I minced and tore them, looking like pieces of waste
paper, troublesome to get rallyed, after such dispersive
scattredness, I had not the leisure to read
what I had written, till it came to a proof, and
sometimes to a full revise. So that by vertue of
this unanimous contest, and joint emulation betwixt
the theoretick and practical part, which of us
should overhye other in celerity, we in the space of
fourteen working daies compleated this whole book,
(such as it is), from the first notion of the brain to
the last motion of the press; and that without any
other help on my side, either of quick or dead, (for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
books I had none, nor possibly would I have made
use of any, although I could have commanded
them), then [than] what, (by the favour of God),
my own judgment and fancy did suggest unto
me."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>The account which our author gives of the
plunder of his manuscripts after the battle of
Worcester, and of the strange series of accidents
by which some of the documents which make up
<i>The Jewel</i> were preserved, is so odd and amusing
that it would be a pity to deprive our readers
of it, though it is related by Sir Thomas at great
length. "No sooner," he says, "had the total rout
of the regal party at Worcester given way to the
taking of that city, and surrendring up of all the
prisoners to the custody of the marshal-general
and his deputies, but the liberty, customary at
such occasions to be connived at in favours of
a victorious army, imboldened some of the new-levied
forces of the adjacent counties to confirm
their conquest by the spoil of the captives. For
the better atchievement of which designe, not
reckoning those great many others that in all the
other corners of the town were ferreting every
room for plunder, a string or two of exquisite snaps
and clean shavers [snappers-up and plunderers?]
(if ever there were any), rushing into Master Spilsbury's
house, (who is a very honest man, and hath
an exceeding good woman to his wife), broke into
an upper chamber, where finding, (besides scarlet
cloaks, buff suits, arms of all sorts, and other such
rich chaffer, at such an exigent escheatable to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
prevalent soldier<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>), seven large portmantles ful of
precious commodity; in three whereof, after a most
exact search for gold, silver, apparel, linen, or any
whatever adornments of the body, or pocket implements,
as was seized upon in the other four,
not hitting on any things but manuscripts in folio,
to the quantity of six score and eight quires and a
half, divided into six hundred fourty and two
quinternions and upwards, the quinternion consisting
of five sheets, and the quire of five and
twenty; besides some writings of suits in law, and
bonds, in both worth above three thousand pounds
English, they in a trice carried all whatever els
was in the room away save those papers, which
they then threw down on the floor as unfit for
their use; yet immediately thereafter, when upon
carts the aforesaid baggage was put to be transported
to the country, and that by the example of
many hundreds of both horse and foot, whom they
had loaded with spoil, they were assaulted with the
temptation of a new booty, they apprehending how
useful the paper might be unto them, went back
for it, and bore it straight away; which done, to
every one of those their camarads whom they met
with in the streets, they gave as much thereof, for
packeting up of raisins, figs, dates, almonds, caraway,
and other such like dry confections and other
ware, as was requisite; who, doing the same themselves,
did together with others kindle pipes of
tobacco with a great part thereof, and threw out all
the remainder upon the streets....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of those dispersedly-rejected bundles of paper,
some were gathered up by grocers, druggists,
chandlers, pie-makers, or such as stood in need of
any cartapaciatory utensil, and put in present
service, to the utter undoing of all the writing
thereof, both in its matter and order. One quinternion,
nevertheless, two days after the fight on
the Friday morning, together with two other loose
sheets more, by vertue of a drizelling rain, which
had made it stick fast to the ground, where there
was a heap of seven and twenty dead men lying
upon one another, was by the command of one
Master Braughton taken up by a servant of his;
who, after he had (in the best manner he could)
cleansed it from the mire and mud of the kennel,
did forthwith present it to the perusal of his
master; in whose hands it no sooner came, but instantly
perceiving by the periodical couching of the
discourse, marginal figures, and breaks here and
there, according to the variety of the subject, that
the whole purpose was destinated for the press, and
by the author put into a garb befitting either the
stationer or printer's acceptance; yet because it
seemed imperfect, and to have relation to subsequent
tractates, he made all the enquiry he could
for trial whether there were any more such quinternions
or no; by means whereof he got full
information that above three thousand sheets of the
like paper, written after that fashion, and with the
same hand, were utterly lost and imbezzeled, after
the manner aforesaid; and was so fully assured of
the misfortune, that to gather up spilt water, comprehend
the windes within his fist, and recover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
those papers again, he thought would be a work of
one and the same labour and facility."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The anonymous personage who gives the above
account says that he heard of Mr Braughton's
discovery of these remarkable documents, and also
of "the great moan made for the loss of Sir
Thomas Urquhart's manuscripts," and, putting the
two facts together, resolved to ask Sir Thomas if
the papers found at Worcester belonged to him.
He examined them, and identified them as part of
the preface to a grammar and lexicon of a Universal
Language, of which he was the inventor. The loss
of a work of such a size and of such great importance
did not greatly depress him. He stated
that if he got but encouragement and time, freedom
and the enjoyment of his ancestral estates, he
doubted not but that he could supply the missing
sheets&mdash;the originals of which had come to such
base uses and disastrous fate at Worcester. The
papers, therefore, found by Mr Braughton are
published in order that the readers may see the
reasonableness of giving Sir Thomas what he asked,
in view of the astounding benefits which he would
in return confer upon them. This is put with
great clearness and brevity in a couplet prefixed to
the above narrative:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He should obtain all his desires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who offers more than he requires."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fragment of the treatise concerning the
Universal Language, which was picked up out of
the gutter of Worcester streets, wiped clean, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
presented to the public in <i>The Jewel</i>, was republished
with additions in Sir Thomas Urquhart's
next work, so that we may here pass it over without
further notice and allude to some of the other
matters treated of.</p>

<p>In order to vindicate the honour of his country,
Sir Thomas Urquhart tells at considerable length of
the fame won by various compatriots of his in war
in every part of Europe, during the earlier half of
the seventeenth century, and he draws the attention
of his readers to the fact that, at no battle in the
period named, were all the Scots that fought overthrown
and totally routed. The explanation of
this statement is that there were always Scots on
both sides, so that, if some were defeated and taken
prisoners, others of that nation were victorious and
givers of quarter. This part of the work is of
great historical value, and, as Burton remarks, is
not liable to the reproach of Urquhart's usual
wandering profuseness of language&mdash;its leading
defect, on the other hand, being its too great
resemblance at times to a muster-roll.</p>

<p>The choicest and most remarkable passage in Sir
Thomas Urquhart's original works is, undoubtedly,
the description he gives in <i>The Jewel</i> of his
fellow-countryman "the Admirable Crichton," who
belonged to the latter part of the sixteenth century.
In an appendix<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> our readers may find a long extract
from it, in which that hero's feats are related. But
for fear of making the appendices out of all proportion
to the size of this volume, the whole sketch
might have been given. To most people the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of "the Admirable Crichton" is now a mere proverbial
phrase to describe a universal genius, and
whether the person who bore it is a historical or a
mythical character, is a matter of some uncertainty.
If any who are possessed of only this amount of
information on the subject seek for more by reading
our author's description of Crichton, the probability
is that they will decide that he is quite
mythical. The extraordinary flightiness, turgidity,
and bombast which mark the narrative, in spite of
its many conspicuous merits, make it seem a mere
piece of burlesque, rather than a genuine history;<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
and yet there is ample evidence of an unimpeachable
kind of the truthfulness of the main statements
which it contains. Sir Thomas Urquhart's
narrative was for a long time one of the principal
sources of information concerning the brilliant
young Scotchman, and the result was that a general
disbelief in the whole history became prevalent.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> As Burton says, "It was from the hands of Sir
Thomas Urquhart that the world accepted of an
idol which, after a period of worship, it cast down,
but so hastily, as it was discovered, that it had
again to be set up, but rather in surly justice than
the old devout admiration."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Tytler, in his <i>Life of
the Admirable Crichton</i>, gives full proof from contemporary
writers that the accomplishments and
feats ascribed to that personage are authentic.</p>

<p>James Crichton was born in 1560, of a noble
family, at Eliock, in Perthshire. At the age of ten
he became a student at St. Andrews, then the most
famous university in Scotland. Before he was
fifteen years of age he graduated as Master of Arts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and stood third in order of merit among the
students of his year. After leaving the university
he spent three years in the pursuit of learning,
devoting himself to one after another of the various
branches of the science and philosophy of his time,
until he had gone through nearly the whole of
them; and, by force of natural ability, aided, no
doubt, by intense application, he acquired the use
of ten different languages.</p>

<p>Some time probably in the year 1578 he began
his foreign travels, with the desire not only to
enlarge his experience of the world, but also to
display the extent of his learning in those public
disputations which were still in fashion at the
continental universities. In form and countenance
he is said to have been a perfect model of manly
beauty; whilst in all the accomplishments of his
time he was as well versed as in the branches of
learning. He was a skilful swordsman, a bold
rider, a graceful dancer, a sweet singer, and a
cultivated musician. Soon after his arrival in
Paris he set up, in accordance with a custom of the
time, in various parts of the city, challenges to
literary and philosophic disputation, and announced
that he would present himself on a certain day at
the College of Navarre, to answer any questions
that might be put to him "in any science, liberal
art, discipline, or faculty, whether practical or
theoretic," and this in any one of twelve specified
languages&mdash;Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Greek, Latin,
Spanish, French, Italian, English, Dutch, Flemish, or
Selavonian. Our readers may find in the appendix
a full narrative in Sir Thomas Urquhart's inim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>itable
style of this extraordinary episode. Though
Crichton seemed to make no preparation for the
learned encounter, to which he had challenged the
most scholarly men in France, he acquitted himself
in such a manner as to astonish all beholders, and
to receive the congratulations of the president and
professors of the University of Paris. From this
display of his intellectual powers and acquirements,
as well as from the brilliant figure he cut at the
balls and tournaments, which were such favourite
employments of the Court of France at that time,
he acquired the title by which he is now universally
known&mdash;that of "the Admirable Crichton."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>It is worth while to compare the passage in
Rabelais which describes the similar feats of the
giant Pantagruel with the account Sir Thomas
Urquhart gives of Crichton's intellectual tournaments.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
To us there seems something very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
ridiculous in the practice of posting up placards on
the walls, challenging all-comers to disputation, but
in the sixteenth century it would not necessarily
appear in this light. Rabelais, indeed, laughed at
it; but then he laughed at many things which the
people of his time did not think absurd. John
Hill Burton is of the opinion that Sir Thomas
Urquhart, in describing the way in which Crichton
conducted himself on the field which had witnessed
Pantagruel's feats, had the ridicule of Rabelais in
view, and that, in spite of his laudations, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
cannot help having the impression that his tongue
is all the time in his cheek. We think that this
is unfair to Sir Thomas. There is no reason why
those who looked on in admiration at a real tournament
should not also enjoy seeing a burlesque
one. So that it is quite possible that our author
smiled while he translated the French satire, and
that he glowed with honest pride and admiration
as he recounted his fellow-countryman's exploits
before the University of Paris.</p>


<p>After serving for a couple of years in the French
army, Crichton journeyed into Italy, and in the
month of August, 1580, arrived in Venice. He
made the acquaintance of the famous printer, Aldus
Manutius, who introduced him to the principal
men of learning and note in that city. Here he
maintained the reputation he had acquired in Paris,
and lives of him were written and published. From
Venice he proceeded to Padua, and from thence to
the Court of Mantua, where the adventure occurred
with which Sir Thomas Urquhart begins the
narrative of his celebrated fellow-countryman's
exploits, namely, the defeat and death of the travelling
bravo, whose challenge he had accepted. Sir
Thomas is the only authority for this incident in
Crichton's history. As there is no reason to believe
that he invented it, we are at liberty to suppose
that he found it in some one of the lives of
Crichton which he met with in his Italian travels,
but which has not come down to us, or that he
heard of it from some of those who witnessed it.
For, as Urquhart was born only twenty-three years
after Crichton's death, he must, in the course of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
his continental travels, have met some who were
his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_211_214" id="FNanchor_211_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_214" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of this achievement, and also
of the brilliant reputation acquired by Crichton, he
was appointed by the Duke of Mantua, companion
and tutor to his son, Vincenzio de Gonzaga, a
young man of some literary culture, but of furious
temper and dissolute morals. Very soon after,
Crichton met his death in a tragical manner. He
was walking home one evening in the streets of
Mantua, from a visit to his mistress, and was
playing a guitar, when suddenly he was attacked
by a riotous party of men in masks, whom, however,
he speedily put to flight. He seized the
leader of the party, overpowered him, and tore off
his mask, and found to his horror that it was his
own pupil, the son of the Duke of Mantua. He
instantly dropped upon one knee, and, in a spirit
of romantic devotion, took his sword by the blade,
and presented its hilt to the prince. Vincenzio,
heated with wine, irritated at his discomfiture, and
also, it is said by some, inspired by jealousy, took
the sword and plunged it into Crichton's heart.
The brilliant young Scotsman was but twenty-two
years of age when he thus met his fate.</p>

<p>The narrative which Sir Thomas Urquhart gives
of the death of his hero is marked by the same
richness of description as is to be found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
account of his exploits as a scholar, a swordsman,
and an actor. In language of astonishing luxuriance
and frequent happiness of phrase, he enlarges upon
the incidents of the last evening of Crichton's life,
and depicts the tender intercourse of the lovers
before the sudden and bloodly close of their
courtship. With a minuteness which, as Tytler
remarks, reminds one of the multitude of particulars
by the enumeration of which Mrs Quickly sought
to bring to Falstaff's remembrance his promise to
marry her,<a name="FNanchor_212_215" id="FNanchor_212_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_215" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Sir Thomas Urquhart depicts the lovers
in the "alcoranal paradise" in which they were
embowered on that evening. "Nothing," he says,
"tending to the pleasure of all the senses was
wanting; the weather being a little chil and
coldish, they on a blue velvet couch sate by one
another towards a char-coale fire burning in a
silver brasero, whilst in the next room adjacent
thereto a pretty little round table of cedar wood
was a covering for the supping of them two
together; the cates prepared for them, and a week<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
before that time bespoke, were of the choisest
dainties and most delicious junkets that all the
territories of Italy were able to afford, and that
deservedly, for all the Romane Empire could not
produce a completer paire to taste them."<a name="FNanchor_213_216" id="FNanchor_213_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_216" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>A tragical note rings through the description of
the lamentation of the hapless girl over her
murdered lover. "She, rending her garments and
tearing her haire, like one of the Graces possest
with a Fury, spoke thus: 'O villains! what have
you done? you vipers of men, that have thus
basely slaine the valiant Crichtoun, the sword of
his own sexe and the buckler of ours, the glory of
this age, and restorer of the lost honour of the
Court of Mantua: O Crichtoun, Crichtoun!'"<a name="FNanchor_214_217" id="FNanchor_214_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_217" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The sequel of the story is in the same vein
of florid eloquence. "The whole court," says Sir
Thomas, "wore mourning for him full three
quarters of a yeer together. His funeral was very
stately, and on his hearse were stuck more epitaphs,
elegies, threnodies, and epicediums, then [than], if
digested into one book, would have outbulk't all
Homer's works; some of them being couched in
such exquisite and fine Latin, that you would have
thought great Virgil, and Baptista Mantuanus, for
the love of their mother-city, had quit the Elysian
fields to grace his obsequies; and other of them,
besides what was done in other languages, composed
in so neat Italian, and so purely fancied, as if
Ariosto, Dante, Petrark, and Bembo had been
purposely resuscitated, to stretch even to the
utmost their poetick vein to the honour of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
brave man; whose picture till this hour is to be
seen in the bed-chambers or galleries of the most
of the great men of that nation, representing him
on horseback, with a lance in one hand and a book
in the other; and most of the young ladies likewise,
<i>that were anything handsome</i>,<a name="FNanchor_215_218" id="FNanchor_215_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_218" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> in a memorial of his
worth, had his effigies in a little oval tablet of gold
hanging 'twixt their breasts, and held, for many
yeers together, that metamazion, or intermammilary
ornament, an as necessary outward pendicle for the
better setting forth of their accoutrements, as
either fan, watch, or stomacher. My lord Duke,
upon the young lady that was Crichtoun's mistres
and future wife, although she had good rents and
revenues of her own by inheritance, was pleased to
conferr a pension of five hundred ducats a yeer.
The Prince also bestowed as much on her during
all the days of his life, which was but short, for he
did not long enjoy himself after the cross fate of
so miserable an accident. The sweet lady, like a
turtle bewailing the loss of her mate, spent all the
rest of her time in a continual solitariness."<a name="FNanchor_216_219" id="FNanchor_216_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_219" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>After giving a long list of his fellow-countrymen
who had won fame in foreign lands by their valour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
learning, or skill, in order to put to silence those
who maligned his nation, Sir Thomas Urquhart
takes up a less pleasing topic&mdash;that of contemporary
politics. In the plainest and most forcible
manner he repudiates the whole policy of the
dominant party in Scotland, and declares that a
true Royalist or Malignant like himself had much
more in common with an Independent, than either
of them had with a Presbyterian; and he enlarges
upon the turbulent disloyalty with which so many
of the last-named party had, in his opinion, conducted
themselves towards their sovereigns since
Queen Mary's time, evidently in forgetfulness for
the moment that his newly-found friends, the
Independents, had executed Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span> and abolished
monarchy.</p>

<p>His account of the mode in which the Presbyterian
or "Consistorian" party were in the habit of treating
their kings is very amusing. "Of a king," he says,
"they onely make use for their own ends, and so
they will of any other supreme magistracie that is
not of their own erection. Their kings are but as
the kings of Lacedemon, whom the Ephors presumed
to fine for any small offence; or as the puppy
[puppet] kings, which, after children have trimmed
with bits of taffata, and ends of silver lace, and set
them upon wainscoat cupboards besides marmalade
and sugar-cakes, are often times disposed of, even by
those that did pretend so much respect unto them,
for a two-peny custard, a pound of figs, or mess of
cream. Verily, I think they make use of kings in
their Consistorian State, as we do of card kings in
playing at the hundred; any one whereof, if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
be appearance of a better game without him, and
that the exchange of him for another incoming card
is like to conduce more for drawing of the stake, is
by good gamesters without any ceremony discarded:
or as the French on the Epiphany-day use their
<i>Roy de la Febre</i>, or king of the bean; whom, after
they have honoured with drinking of his health,
and shouting <i>Le Roy boit, le Roy boit</i>, they make pay
for all the reckoning; not leaving him sometimes
one peny, rather then [than] that the exorbitancie
of their debosh should not be satisfied to the full.
They may be likewise said to use their king as the
players at nine-pins do the middle kyle, which they
call the king; at whose fall alone they aim, the
sooner to obtain the gaining of their prize; or
as about Christmas we do the King of Misrule,
whom we invest with that title to no other end
but to countenance the bacchanalian riots and
preposterous disorders of the family where he is
installed. The truth of all this appears by their
demeanour to Charles the Second, whom they
crowned their king at Sterlin, and who, though
he be for comeliness of person, valour, affability,
mercy, piety, closeness of counsel, veracity, foresight,
knowledge, and other vertues both moral and intellectual,
in nothing inferior to any of his hundred
and ten predecessors, had nevertheless no more rule
in effect over the Presbyterian Senate of Scotland,
then [than] any of the six foresaid mock-kings had
above those by whom they were dignified with the
splendour of royal pomp."<a name="FNanchor_217_220" id="FNanchor_217_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_220" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>The passage in <i>The Jewel</i> which tells of the faults
of the clergy, as illustrated by the conduct of the
ministers of the parishes of which Sir Thomas was
patron, has already been given in these pages, and
therefore need not be repeated here; but room
must be found for the paragraph in which he
denounces those who by their covetousness had cast
a slur upon the Scottish name. The art of writing
such English perished with him, its inventor; and
one cannot be too thankful for such a passage as
the following. "Another thing there is," he says,
"that fixeth a grievous scandal upon that nation in
matter of philargyrie, or love of money, and it is
this: There hath been in London, and repairing to
it, for these many years together, a knot of Scotish
bankers, collybists, or coine-coursers, of traffickers
in merchandise to and againe, and of men of other
professions, who by hook and crook, <i>fas et nefas</i>,
slight and might, (all being as fish their net could
catch), having feathered their nests to some purpose,
look so idolatrously upon their Dagon of wealth, and
so closely, (like the earth's dull center), hug all unto
themselves, that for no respect of vertue, honour,
kinred, patriotism, or whatever else, (be it never so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
recommendable), will they depart from so much as
one single peny, whose emission doth not, without
any hazard of loss, in a very short time superlucrate
beyond all conscience an additionall increase to
the heap of that stock which they so much adore;
which churlish and tenacious humor hath made
many that were not acquainted with any else of
that country, to imagine all their compatriots infected
with the same leprosie of a wretched peevishness,
whereof those <i>quomodocunquizing</i> clusterfists
and rapacious varlets have given of late such
cannibal-like proofs, by their inhumanity and
obdurate carriage towards some, (whose shoe-strings
they are not worthy to unty), that were it not that
a more able pen then [than] mine will assuredly
not faile to jerk them on all sides, in case, by their
better demeanour for the future, they endeavour not
to wipe off the blot wherewith their native country,
by their sordid avarice and miserable baseness, hath
been so foully stained, I would at this very instant
blaze them out in their names and surnames, notwithstanding
the vizard of Presbyterian zeal wherewith
they maske themselves, that like so many
wolves, foxes, or Athenian Timons, they might in
all times coming be debarred the benefit of any
honest conversation."<a name="FNanchor_218_221" id="FNanchor_218_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_221" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>After suggesting a number of ways in which the
tone of society in Scotland might be raised and
sweetened&mdash;one of which is the establishment of
"a free schoole and standing library in every
parish"<a name="FNanchor_219_222" id="FNanchor_219_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_222" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>&mdash;Sir Thomas proceeds to argue in a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sensible and convincing manner for complete union
between Scotland and England. The subject is
introduced by lengthy quotations from speeches by
Bacon, delivered by him in Parliament as far back
as the year 1608, in which the advantages of such
an arrangement are set forth.</p>

<p>The style of our author is seen at its worst in
the peroration to <i>The Jewel</i>, in which he apologizes
for the comparative simplicity, if not baldness, by
which, in the opinion of some, it might be thought
to be characterised. "I could truly," he says, "have
enlarged this discourse with a choicer variety of
phrase, and made it overflow the field of the
reader's understanding, with an inundation of greater
eloquence; and that one way, tropologetically, by
metonymical, ironical, metaphorical, and synecdochical
instruments of elocution, in all their
several kinds, artificially affected, according to the
nature of the subject, with emphatical expressions
in things of great concernment, with catachrestical
in matters of meaner moment; attended on each
side respectively with an epiplectick and exegetick
modification; with hyperbolical, either epitatically
or hypocoristically, as the purpose required to be
elated or extenuated, with qualifying metaphors,
and accompanied by apostrophes; and lastly, with
allegories of all sorts, whether apologal, affabulatory,
parabolary, &aelig;nigmatick, or par&aelig;mial. And on the
other part, schematologetically adorning the proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
theam with the most especial and chief flowers of
the garden of rhetorick, and omitting no figure either
of diction or sentence, that might contribute to the
ear's enchantment, or perswasion of the hearer. I
could have introduced, in case of obscurity, synonymal,
exargastick, and palilogetick elucidations; for
sweetness of phrase, antimetathetick commutations
of epithets; for the vehement excitation of a matter,
exclamation in the front, and epiphonemas in the
reer. I could have used, for the promptlier stirring
up of passion, apostrophal and prosopop&#339;iel diversions;
and, for the appeasing and settling of them,
some epanorthotick revocations, and aposiopetick
restraines. I could have inserted dialogismes,
displaying their interrogatory part with communicatively
pysmatick and sustentative flourishes; or
proleptically, with the refutative schemes of anticipation
and subjection, and that part which concerns
the responsory, with the figures of permission and
concession. Speeches extending a matter beyond
what it is, auxetically, digressively, transitiously, by
ratiocination, &aelig;tiology, circumlocution, and other
wayes, I could have made use of; as likewise with
words diminishing the worth of a thing, tapinotically,
periphrastically, by rejection, translation, and other
meanes, I could have served myself."<a name="FNanchor_220_223" id="FNanchor_220_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_223" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>He goes on for a long time in this strain, and
is at pains to explain that, if the work had been
written in this more elaborate manner, it would not
necessarily have been found tedious even by young
ladies. "I could have presented it to the imagination,"
he says, "in so spruce a garb, that spirits
blest with leisure, and free from the urgency of
serious employments, would happily have bestowed
as liberally some few houres thereon as on the
perusal of a new-coined romance, or strange history
of love adventures. For although the figures and
tropes above rehearsed seem in their <i>actu signato</i>, (as
they signifie meer notional circumstances, affections,
adjuncts, and dependencies on words), to be a little
pedantical, and to the smooth touch of a delicate
ear somewhat harsh and scabrous, yet in their
exerced act, (as they suppone for things reduplicatively
as things in the first apprehension of the
minde, by them signified), I could, even in far abstruser
purposes, have so fitly adjusted them with apt and
proper termes, and with such perspicuity couched
them, as would have been suitable to the capacities
of courtiers and young ladies,<a name="FNanchor_221_224" id="FNanchor_221_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_224" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> whose tender hearing,
for the most part, being more taken with the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>sinuating
harmony of a well-concerted period, in its
isocoletick and parisonal members, then [than] with
the never-so-pithy a fancy of a learned subject,
destitute of the illustriousness of so pathetick
ornaments, will sooner convey perswasion to the
interior faculties from the ravishing assault of a
well-disciplined diction, in a parade of curiously-mustered
words in their several ranks and files
then [than] by the vigour and fierceness of never so
many powerful squadrons of a promiscuously-digested
elocution into bare logical arguments; for the sweetness
of their disposition is more easily gained by
undermining passion then [than] storming reason,
and by the musick and symmetry of a descourse
in its external appurtenances, then [than] by all
the puissance imaginary of the ditty or purpose
disclosed by it."<a name="FNanchor_222_225" id="FNanchor_222_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_225" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The last of Sir Thomas Urquhart's original works
was his "<span class="smcap">Logopandecteision</span>, or an <span class="smcap">Introduction to
the Universal Language</span>," a portion of which, as
already mentioned, had been embedded in the conglomerate
mass of <i>The Jewel</i>. The idea of a universal
language was not originated by Urquhart, for it is
said that something of the kind had been planned a
generation earlier by the celebrated William Bedell
(1570-1642), the Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh,
who is better known for promoting the translation
of the Bible into the Irish tongue. We are
told by Burnet, who wrote his life, that he had
in his diocese a clergyman named Johnston, a man
of ability, but, unfortunately, of "mercurial wit."
In order to give him adequate employment, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
keep him, we suppose, out of mischief, Bedell
planned out a scheme for a universal character,
which should be understood by all nations as
readily as the Arabic numerals or the figures in
geometry, and started Johnston upon the task of
completing it. He made, we are told, considerable
progress with the scheme, but his labours were
interrupted, and the results of them destroyed, by
the frightful rebellion of 1641.</p>

<p>The <i>Logopandecteision</i><a name="FNanchor_223_226" id="FNanchor_223_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_226" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> is divided into six books,
which bear names of the remarkable kind which
seem to come so readily to Urquhart's tongue, and
are so hard to be compassed by the tongues of
others. The "Epistle Dedicatorie" is an elaborate
piece of writing, and is animated by considerable
bitterness of spirit. It is addressed to Nobody&mdash;the
person who has assisted him in his labours,
pitied him in his sorrows, and relieved him in his
penury. It is only the first book&mdash;entitled
"Neaudethaumata, or Wonders of the New Speech"&mdash;which
makes a pretence of dealing with the professed
subject of the volume, and of laying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
great scheme before the reader. Much to the
gratification of the judicious student of the work,
Urquhart rambles off in the remaining books into
autobiographical details, from which we have already
gleaned heavily in the earlier chapters of this
volume, and the only connexion between them and
the Universal Language is that they show the
difficulties which prevented the author from carrying
out his plan. The sources from which these
difficulties arose are vaguely indicated in the titles of
the books: thus, the second is called "Chrestasebeia,
or Impious Dealing of Creditors"; the third, "Cleronomaporia,
or the Intricacy of a Distressed Successor
or Apparent Heir"; the fourth, "Chryseomystes, or
the Covetous Preacher"; and the fifth, "Neleodicastes,
or the Pitiless Judge." While the sixth book is entitled
"Philoponauxesis, or Furtherance of Industry,"
and tells of the marvellous benefits which would accrue
to all branches of trade, manufacture, and industry
in Scotland, if the writer's demands were granted,
and he were at liberty to carry out the multitudinous
schemes with which his mind was filled. The
volume concludes with requests or "proquiritations"
from thirty-two distinct petitioners, who modestly
conceal themselves from public notice under the
shelter of the initial letters of their names, that the
State would, for the various weighty reasons which
they allege, grant the desire of Sir Thomas to be
set free, and to be established in possession of the
estates and honours which his family had enjoyed
from time immemorial. This section of the work
suggests failure in ingenuity on the part of the
author, for few persons above the condition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
idiocy could surely be found capable of believing
that the reasons and initials alike were anything
else than the concoction of Sir Thomas himself.</p>

<p>Very slight indeed can be the notice which we
are able to give of the proposed Universal Language,
the description of which, as set forth in the early
part of the <i>Logopandecteision</i>, is more like an incoherent
dream than anything else. There is no
evidence that Sir Thomas Urquhart ever really
made a grammar or vocabulary of the new language.
Indeed, he writes about it in such a manner as to
lead one to think that he had made no way in the
real working out of the scheme, but merely dreamed
of what he was going to do. In the new tongue
which was to supersede all others there were to be
twelve parts of speech, all words would have at
least ten synonyms, nouns and pronouns would
have eleven cases and four numbers&mdash;singular,
dual, plural, and redual&mdash;and verbs would have
four voices, seven moods, and eleven tenses. "In
this tongue," says the author, "there are eleven
genders,<a name="FNanchor_224_227" id="FNanchor_224_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_227" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> wherein," he truthfully adds, "it exceedeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
all other languages." "Every word in this language,"
we are told, "signifieth as well backward as forward,
and however you invert the letters, still shall you
fall upon significant words, whereby a wonderful
facility is obtained in making of anagrams....
Of all languages, this is the most compendious in
complement, and consequently fittest for courtiers
and ladies.... As its interjections are more
numerous, so are they more emphatical in their
respective expression of passions, then [than] that
part of speech is in any other language whatsoever."<a name="FNanchor_225_228" id="FNanchor_225_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_228" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
And finally Sir Thomas vouches for its conciseness
in a hyperbole which it would be difficult to excel.
"This language," he says, "affordeth so concise
words for numbering, that the number for setting
down, whereof would require in vulgar arithmetic
more figures in a row then [than] there might be
grains of sand containable from the center of the
earth to the highest heavens, is in it expressed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
two letters."<a name="FNanchor_226_229" id="FNanchor_226_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_229" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> A considerable revenue might be
secured if the rule found at the end of some of
Grimm's <i>Household Tales</i> were applied to this statement,
and strictly enforced: "Whosoever does not
believe this must pay a thaler." In a very innocent
manner our author excuses himself for the extravagant
praise he has poured out upon his own
invention. "Why it is," he exclaims, "I should
extoll the worth thereof, without the jeopardy of
vaine glory, the reason is clear and evident, being
necessitated ... to merchandise it for the redintegrating
of an ancient family, it needeth not be
thought strange, that in some measure I descend
to the fashion of the shop-keepers, who, to scrue
up the buyer to the higher price, will tell them no
better can be had for mony, 'tis the choicest ware
in England, and if any can match it, he shall have
it for nought.... [And so] I went on in my
laudatives, to procure the greater longing, that an
ardent desire might stir up an emacity [a propensity
to buy], to the furtherance of my proposed
end." One is obliged sadly to assent to his further
statement about such conduct&mdash;"whereof ...
there wanteth not store of presidents [precedents]."<a name="FNanchor_227_230" id="FNanchor_227_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_230" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>


<p>Hugh Miller, animated by the patriotic zeal
which prompts one North Briton to stand by
another, and with the desire to make out the best
case possible for one who was not only a fellow-countryman,
but also a fellow-townsman, speaks in
high terms of Urquhart's inventive powers as displayed
in the <i>Logopandecteision</i>. "The new chemical
vocabulary," he says, "with all its philosophical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
ingenuity, is constructed on principles exactly
similar to those which he divulged more than a
hundred years prior to its invention, in the preface
to his Universal Language."<a name="FNanchor_228_231" id="FNanchor_228_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_231" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> This is a statement
which it is rather difficult to understand. The only
indication of the nature of the new tongue which
we can glean from Sir Thomas's description of it,
is that every letter of every word in it would have
a meaning, so that when anyone who knew the
principles of the language heard a word for the
first time, he would understand it.<a name="FNanchor_229_232" id="FNanchor_229_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_232" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Now, of course,
it is true that anyone who knows the principle of
the nomenclature of salts, to which, we suppose,
Hugh Miller refers, can tell a good deal about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
salt from the name of it, say, nitrate of potassium,
KNO<sub>3</sub>, but it would be impossible to invent a
systematic nomenclature of which this would not
be true.</p>

<p>The same author is also very much impressed by
the fact that the new language was to contain the
dual, and regards this, on Lord Monboddo's authority,
as a proof of philosophical acumen on the part
of the inventor. He does not take any notice of
the "redual," which the language was also to contain,
and which might have been taken as an
indication of double-distilled wisdom. Lord Monboddo
(1714-1799) says of the Greek language
that if there "were nothing else to convince him of
its being a work of philosophers and grammarians,
its dual number would of itself be sufficient; for as
certainly as the principles of body are the point,
the line, and the surface, the principles of number
are the monad and the duad, though philosophers
only are aware of the fact." The idea that this
venerated instrument for the expression or concealment
of thought was the concoction of a committee
of primitive sages, and that they deliberately invented

Greeks were quite so malicious as to do a thing
like that. It is more probably the case that, like
other Aryans, they received the dual as part of
the inheritance of the past, handed down to them,
and retained it; while in some of the cognate
languages<a name="FNanchor_231_234" id="FNanchor_231_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_234" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> it was gradually rubbed off, very much

of the dirt</i>." Dr Irving, the author of a very carefully-written
memoir of Sir Thomas Urquhart, in his <i>Lives of Scottish Writers</i>,
vol. ii., is a little puzzled by this extraordinary name. The latter
part of it was, he thought, perhaps connected with &#945;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;&mdash;"to-morrow"&mdash;in
allusion to the fact that this "exquisite Jewel" was
taken out of the kennel <i>the morrow</i> after the battle of Worcester.
But the word is evidently &#945;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#957;&mdash;the Lat. <i>aurum</i>, "gold." In the
"Postilla" to the Pedigree of the Urquharts, our author says that
"the shire of Cromartie ... hath the names of its towns, villages,
hamlets, dwellings, promontories, hillocks, temples, dens, groves,
fountains, rivers, pools, lakes, stone heaps, akers, and so forth,
of pure and perfect Greek." We need not be surprised that Sir
Thomas's Greek has more affinity with the vernacular form of the
language current in the Cromartie of his time than with the Attic
of the age of Pericles,

"<i>For Greke of Athenes was to him unknow&eacute;.</i>"<br />

Probably in this northern dialect of the Greek tongue &#945;&#8017;&#961;&#959;&#957; was
used instead of the more classical &#967;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#8001;&#962;. Another indication of
the difference between the Cromartian and Attic forms of speech
is given by Sir Thomas in the same treatise in the name &#913;&#955;&#949;&#958;&#7937;&#957;&#948;&#951;&#961;,
which Thucydides would have written &#913;&#955;&#7953;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;.</p></div>

many of the peculiarities of the two Sir Thomas Urquharts, the
father and the son, and who has recorded his experiences in an
<i>Autobiography</i>, lays stress in like manner upon this quality of
speed in composition. Thus he says of his little novel, <i>Mary de
Clifford</i> (published in 1792), "it was written with a fervent
rapidity, which no one seems to believe;&mdash;begun in October, 1791,
and the sheets sent to the press by the post, as fast as they were
scribbled." The passage in which he refers to the vexations to
which he had been subjected is worth quoting, on account of its
similarity to our Sir Thomas's story. "I have suffered," he says,
"a hundred times more disappointments, and crosses, and insults,
and wrongs, and deprivations, than Chatterton, yet my spirit,
though bent and sunk, was never broken. I am calm and defiant,
though not hopeful, in proportion as the storm presses me;&mdash;and
what trials have I not undergone? I do not mean to relate all
these trials; it would involve the conduct of obscure individuals,
many of whom are still living" (<i>Autobiography</i>, pp. 8, 9).</p></div>

affords an indication of the saturation of Urquhart's mind with the
style of Rabelais. It might almost be pieced together from the
meeting of Pantagruel with the Limousin scholar, the discomfiture
of Thaumast by Panurge, and the meeting of Pantegruel and his

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_207_207" id="Footnote_207_207"></a><a href="#FNanchor_207_207"><span class="label">[207]</span></a> Dr Kippis, the editor of the <i>Biographia Britannica, or Lives
of the Most Eminent Persons who have Flourished in Great Britain
and Ireland</i> (1789), had a bad time in writing the notice of
Crichton that appears in it. He says that he entered upon the
task with diffidence, and even with anxiety. On the one hand,
he was desirous not to detract from Crichton's real merit, and, on
the other, he wished to form a just estimate of the truth of the
facts which are recorded concerning him. Part of his perturbation
of mind was due to the indignation which he felt towards our
author, whose narrative of Crichton's adventures he regarded as
utterly untrustworthy. At an early stage in the article he
remarks: "And here it must be observed that no credit can be
granted to any facts which depend upon the sole authority of Sir
Thomas Urquhart.... I must declare my full persuasion that
Sir Thomas Urquhart is an author whose testimony to facts is
totally unworthy of regard; and it is surprising that a perusal of
his works does not strike every mind with this conviction. His
productions are so inexpressibly absurd and extravagant, that the
only rational judgment which can be pronounced concerning him
is, that he was little, if at all, better than a madman. To the
character of his having been a madman must be added that of his
being a liar. Severe as this term may be thought, I apprehend
that a diligent examination of the treatise which contains the
memorials concerning Crichton would show that it is strictly true."
The censure uttered by Dr Kippis <i>is</i> very severe, but some excuse
for him is easily found. He was anxious to make his dictionary
of biography a mine of facts on which the public could rely with
absolute confidence; and he saw before him the danger of quoting
as an authority a writer like Urquhart, who so palpably elongated
facts and embroidered them with fancies. His opinion with
regard to the <i>Pedigree</i> of the Urquharts is given on p. 144.</p></div>

would one day make trial of his knowledge. Thereupon in all
the Carrefours, that is, throughout all the foure quarters, streets
and corners of the city, he set up Conclusions to the number of
nine thousand seven hundred sixty and foure,<a name="FNanchor_A_211" id="FNanchor_A_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_211" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in all manner of
learning, touching in them the hardest doubts that are in any
science. And first of all, in the Fodder-street<a name="FNanchor_B_212" id="FNanchor_B_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_212" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> he held disputes
against all the Regents or Fellowes of Colledges, Artists or Masters
of Arts, and Oratours, and did so gallantly, that he overthrew
them, and set them all upon their tailes. He went afterwards to
the Sorboune, where he maintained argument against all the
Theologians or Divines, for the space of six weeks, from foure
a clock in the morning until six in the evening, except an interval
of two houres to refresh themselves, and take their repast. And at
this were present the greatest part of the Lords of the Court,
the Masters of Requests, Presidents, Counsellors, those of the
Accompts, Secretaries, Advocates, and others: as also the Sheriffes
of the said town, with the Physicians and Professors of the Canon-Law.
Amongst which it is to be remarked, that the greatest part
were stubborn jades, and in their opinions obstinate; but he took
such course with them, that, for all their ergo's and fallacies, he
put their backs to the wall, gravelled them in the deepest
questions, and made it visibly appear to the world, that, compared
to him, they were but monkies, and a knot of mufled calves.
Whereupon everybody began to keep a bustling noise, and talk of
his so marvellous knowledge, through all degrees of persons in both
sexes, even to the very laundresses, brokers, rostmeat-sellers,
penknife-makers, and others, who, when he past along in the
street, would say, This is he! in which he took delight, as

for he has really done pretty well as it is. Mr Ruskin had once a
vision of ten thousand school-inspectors assembled on Cader Idris.

class in elementary English, and the above passage were read out

of such a large number suggests to one that in Sir Thomas's
Universal Language the distinctions in question were to receive
an undue amount of attention. At the same time, fault has been
found with our English language for being somewhat defective in
accentuating these distinctions; and an attempt to correct this
shortcoming, to a certain extent, has been made by Southey in
<i>The Doctor</i>. He proposed to anglicise the orthography of the
female garment, "which is indeed the sister to the shirt," and
then to utilise the hint offered in its new form: thus <i>Hemise</i> and
<i>Shemise</i>. In letter-writing every person knows that male and female
letters have a distinct character; they should therefore, he thought,
be generally distinguished thus, <i>Hepistle</i> and <i>Shepistle</i>. And as
there is the same marked difference in the writing of the
two sexes, he proposed <i>Penmanship</i> and <i>Penwomanship</i>. Erroneous
opinions in religion being promulgated in this country by women
as well as men, the teachers of such false doctrine may be divided
into <i>Heresiarchs</i> and <i>Sheresiarchs</i>, so that we should speak of the
<i>Heresy</i> of the Quakers and the <i>Sheresy</i> of Joanna Southcote's
people. The troublesome affection of the diaphragm, which every
one has experienced, is, upon the same principle, to be called,
according to the sex of the patient, <i>Hecups</i>, or <i>Shecups</i>, which,
upon the principle of making our language truly British, is better
than the more classical form of <i>Hiccups</i> and <i>H&aelig;cups</i>. In its objective
use the word becomes Hiscups or Hercups; and in like manner
Histerics should be altered into Herterics, the complaint never
being masculine. It is perhaps a little surprising that this
suggestion should have lain before the British public for half a
century, and have been left unutilised.</p></div>

good reasons for believing that the above volume was really
by Sir Thomas Urquhart, and was dishonestly put forth as the
work of the Marquis of Worcester. He does not give us any
of his reasons. The style of the little volume bears no resemblance
to that of our author, and this fact is of itself almost conclusive
proof that Sir Thomas Urquhart had nothing to do with it. The
Scottish knight could scarcely open his lips without revealing his
identity. It is rather difficult to believe, too, that a manuscript
lost by Sir Thomas in the streets of Worcester should have been
picked up by the Marquis of Worcester. The coincidence would
be a very extraordinary one.</p></div>

<img src="images/t.jpg" width="90" height="78" alt="" title="" />
</div><p>HE foundation on which Sir Thomas
Urquhart's literary fame securely
rests is his translation into English
of the first three books of the works
of Rabelais. Of these the first and
second appeared in two separate
volumes in the year 1653&mdash;exactly a century after
the death of the great French satirist&mdash;and the
third was published by Pierre Antoine Motteux
in 1693, long after Sir Thomas's own death.<a name="FNanchor_232_235" id="FNanchor_232_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_235" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>The difficulty, singularity, and obscurity of the
writings of Rabelais had probably been hindrances
in the way of their being presented to the English
public in their own tongue; for, though the register
of the Stationers' Company preserves a record of
two attempts at translation, these seem to have been
but fragmentary, and to have dropped still-born from
the press. The works themselves are not known to
be extant, and nothing more than the bare name of
them survives.</p>

<p>The difficulties which lie in the way of the
ordinary reader who wishes to become acquainted
with the works of Rabelais are very considerable.<a name="FNanchor_233_236" id="FNanchor_233_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_236" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
The fantastical style of the satirist, his countless
allusions to contemporary persons and events, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
out-of-the-way learning, the care with which he
conceals at such length the seriousness of his
purpose, and the incredible grossness of manners
which so often disfigures his pages, are obstacles
which can with difficulty be surmounted. The last-mentioned
characteristic is, indeed, a grave and ingrained
fault, which must for ever be a slur upon
the writer's fame. Yet we may say of him what
Don Pedro says of Benedick, "The man doth fear
God howsoever it seems not in him by some large
jests he will make"; or what Mrs Blower in <i>St
Ronan's Well</i> says of her deceased husband, "He
was a merry man, but he had the root of the matter
in him for a' his light way of speaking." Coleridge&mdash;"the
brother," according to Mr Birrell, "whose
praise is throughout all the churches"&mdash;speaks of
Rabelais in very high terms indeed; "Beyond a
doubt," he says, "he was among the deepest, as
well as boldest thinkers of his age. His buffoonery
was not merely Brutus' rough stick, which contained
a rod of gold: it was necessary as an amulet against
the monks and legates.<a name="FNanchor_234_237" id="FNanchor_234_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_237" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Never was there a more
plausible, and seldom, I am persuaded, a less appropriate
line than the thousand times quoted</p>

<p>
'Rabelais laughing in his easy chair'<br />
</p>

<p>of Mr Pope. The caricature of his filth and zany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ism
show how fully he both knew and felt the
danger in which he stood. I could write a treatise
in praise of the moral elevation of Rabelais' work,
which would make the church stare and the conventicle
groan,<a name="FNanchor_235_238" id="FNanchor_235_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_238" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and yet would be truth, and nothing
but the truth. I class Rabelais with the great
creative minds of the world, Shakespeare, Dante,
Cervantes, etc."</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais was born in Touraine, according
to the date usually given, and which there is
no reason to question, in the same year as Luther
and Raphael, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1483, and died in Paris in 1553.
His father had a small estate, and was an apothecary
(or, as some say, a tavern-keeper) in the town
of Chinon, at the foot of the castle where, three
centuries before, our Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> had died, and
whither, a little more than fifty years before
Fran&ccedil;ois was born, Joan of Arc had come with
promises of supernatural aid to Charles <span class="smcap">VII.</span> He
was the youngest of five sons, and, as was often the
case in those days, was provided for by being made
a monk, while the other members of the family
divided amongst them the paternal estate. In one
passage in his works he speaks of mothers who
"cannot bear their children nor brook them in
their houses nine, nay often not seven years, but by
putting a shirt over their robe, and by cutting a few
hairs on the top of their head ... they transform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
them into birds," <i>i.e.</i>, get rid of them as soon as
possible, and thrust them into monasteries. This
seems to have been his own sad fate.</p>

<p>In course of time, after the schoolboy period of
his life was past, he entered the order of Franciscan
monks at the convent of Fontenay-le-Comte in
Poitou, and took holy orders; and it was here, during
the next fifteen years (1509-1524), that he
devoted himself to the acquisition of everything in
the shape of literature or learning, and laid the
foundation of the astonishing erudition which his
works display. His long residence in the monastery
had inspired Rabelais with a deep hatred of
monasticism and monks, and, after being allowed to
exchange the Franciscan for the Benedictine order,
he laid down the regular habit and took that of a
secular priest, and left the convent without the
sanction of his superior&mdash;a breach of ecclesiastical
discipline which exposed him to severe censure.
After wandering hither and thither in the pursuit
of medical knowledge, he entered the University of
Montpellier, graduated as a physician, and practised
there with credit and success. After being Hospital
Physician at Lyons, he spent some time in Rome,
as a medical attendant upon Jean du Bellay, Bishop
of Paris. While here he succeeded in making his
peace with the Church, and by a papal Bull (17th
January 1536) was allowed to return to the Benedictine
order and to practise physic according to
canonical rules, <i>i.e.</i>, to charge no fees and to use
neither fire nor knife. This release from ecclesiastical
disabilities allowed him to be appointed to a
place in the abbey of St Maur-des-Fosses, near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Paris. After another period of exile and wandering
he was nominated cur&eacute; of Meudon, an office which he
resigned after two years. Three months afterwards
he died in Paris (9th April, 1553), and was buried
in the cemetery of the parish of St Paul's.</p>

<p>The publication of the satirical writings of
Rabelais was spread over a long series of years,
from 1532 or 1533, when the first installment,
in his <i>Gargantua</i>, was brought out, down to
1564, eleven years after his death, when the
fifth and concluding book of his <i>Pantagruel</i> was
issued in its entirety. The main object of his
satire was what used to be called "the intolerance,
superstition, and disgusting follies and vices of the
Romish Church," but, incidentally, pretenders to
knowledge of every kind come under his lash. For
when imposture, folly, and humbug grow too rank
and noisome, there arise, it can scarcely be by accident,
men like Lucian, Rabelais, and Voltaire, whose
calling it is to cut them down. That theirs is an
ill-requited office is sufficiently plain from the odium
which, in spite of their beneficent labours, is often
associated with their names. "[Hast thou] only a
torch for burning, no hammer for building?" says
the somewhat wearisome Herr Teufelsdr&ouml;ckh to
the last named of these satirists, "take our thanks,
then, and&mdash;thyself away."<a name="FNanchor_236_239" id="FNanchor_236_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_239" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Yet the torch for
burning is as necessary as the hammer for building,
if the site for the Temple of Truth is to be prepared.
It may well be that burning down and
rooting up are needed before building can be begun,
and some of those who have endeavoured to benefit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
mankind have felt themselves called to the one sort
of work rather than to the other.</p>

<p>The form which Rabelais chooses for the frame-work
of his satire is the burlesque adventures of
the giant Gargantua, of whom many legends were
current in Touraine, and of his son Pantagruel,
sometimes spoken of as also a giant, and at others
as a wise and virtuous prince of ordinary proportions.
Along with the strange, tangled, and chaotic
story of their exploits the writer from time to time
enunciates admirable ideas, which must have seemed
revolutionary to his contemporaries, and some of
which even we have not yet realised.</p>

<p>The translation of Rabelais by Sir Thomas
Urquhart is his great literary achievement. "It is
impossible," says Tytler, "to look into it without
admiring the air of ease, freshness, and originality
which the translator has so happily communicated
to his performance. All those singular qualifications
which unfitted Urquhart to succeed in serious
composition&mdash;his extravagance, his drollery (?), his
unbridled imagination, his burlesque and endless
epithets&mdash;are in the task of translating Rabelais
transplanted into their true field of action, and
revel through his pages with a licence and buoyancy
which is quite unbridled, yet quite allowable. Indeed,
Urquhart and Rabelais appear, in many points,
to have been congenial spirits, and the translator
seems to have been born for his author."<a name="FNanchor_237_240" id="FNanchor_237_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_240" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>As might have been expected, the translation is
not marked by painful exactness of rendering. On
the contrary, evidences of carelessness and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>accuracy
are by no means uncommon, but yet the
work is, as some one calls it, "one of the most
perfect transfusions of an author from one language
to another,<a name="FNanchor_238_241" id="FNanchor_238_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_241" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> that ever man accomplished." The
great merits of the translation consist in its preserving
the very air and style of the original, and
in the astonishing richness of vocabulary which it
manifests. Where Rabelais invents a word, Sir
Thomas invents one, or two, or three; and if the
former has a list of twenty or thirty epithets, the
latter has no hesitation in supplying his readers
with forty or sixty, which seem quite as good as
the original stock which he thus enlarges. Sometimes,
too, as Mr W. F. Smith, a very distinguished
student of Rabelais, remarks, "in translating a
single word of the French he often empties all the
synonyms given by Cotgrave into his version."</p>

<p>Mr Tytler, in the above-quoted criticism on
Urquhart's translation, speaks of the peculiarities of
his style as "revelling through his pages with a
licence and buoyancy which is quite unbridled, yet
quite allowable." One is obliged to demur to the
last adjective. A translator, like a compositor,
should be under some obligation to adhere to the
text before him; and, as a matter of fact, the
success of Urquhart's version is occasionally interfered
with by this same "unbridled revelling."
The style of Rabelais is graphic and vigorous, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
at times exceedingly graceful, and occupies a high
place in French literature. Any tampering with it,
therefore, in the way of alteration or addition, was
not likely to be an improvement.</p>

<p>But, even after all deductions are made, the praise
bestowed upon Urquhart's work has been fully
deserved. "The buoyancy and unembarrassed sweep
of its general character," says Sir Theodore Martin,
"which gives his Rabelais more the look of an
original than of a translation, its rich and well-compacted
diction, the many happy turns of phrase
that are quite his own, have fairly earned for it the
high estimation in which it has long been held.
His task was one of extreme difficulty, and there
have perhaps been few men besides himself that
could have brought to it the world of omnigenous
knowledge which it required. It was apparently
Urquhart's ambition to realise in his own person
the ideal of human accomplishment, to be at once</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Complete in feature and in mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all good grace to grace a gentleman.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had left no source of information unexplored,
few aspects of life unobserved, and, in the translation
of Rabelais, he found full exercise for his
multiform attainments. Ably as the work has
been completed by Motteux, one cannot but regret
that the worthy Knight of Cromarty had not
spared him the task."<a name="FNanchor_239_242" id="FNanchor_239_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_242" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The merits of the translation can scarcely be
exhibited in selections torn from their context, and
perhaps only partly intelligible; but perhaps the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
following may be welcome to the reader. Let us
take these extracts from the graceful and charming
sketch of the Abbey of Thelema, which was to be
different from all other monastic communities,
and was to be the home of a society of young
people living together in all innocence and joy, free
from sordid cares, and devoted to the studies, exercises,
and accomplishments which are appropriate
to refined and noble spirits.</p>

<p>"'First, then,' said Gargantua, 'you must not
build a wall about your convent, for all other
abbies are strongly walled and mured about....
Moreover, seeing there are certain convents in the
world, whereof the custome is, if any woman come
in, I mean chaste and honest women, they immediately
sweep the ground which they have trod
upon;<a name="FNanchor_240_243" id="FNanchor_240_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_243" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> therefore was it ordained, that if any man
or woman, entered into religious orders, should by
chance come within this new abbey, all the roomes
should be thoroughly washed and cleansed through
which they had passed. And because in all other
monasteries and nunneries all is compassed, limited,
and regulated by houres, it was decreed that in this
new structure there should be neither clock nor
dial, but that, according to the opportunities and
incident occasions, all their hours should be disposed
of; for,' said Gargantua, 'the greatest losse
of time, that I know, is to count the hours. What
good comes of it? Nor can there be any greater
dotage in the world then [than] for one to guide
and direct his courses by the sound of a bell, and
not by his owne judgement and discretion.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>"Item, Because at that time they put no women
into nunneries, but such as were either purblind,
blinkards, lame, crooked, ill-favoured, misshapen,
fooles, senselesse, spoyled, or corrupt; nor encloystered
any men, but those that were either
sickly, ill-bred lowts, simple sots, or peevish trouble-houses; ...
therefore was it ordained, that into
this religious order should be admitted no women
that were not faire, well featur'd, and of a sweet
disposition; nor men that were not comely, personable,
and well conditioned.</p>

<p>"Item, Because in the convents of women men
come not but under-hand, privily, and by stealth, it
was therefore enacted, that in this house there shall
be no women in case there be not men, nor men in
case there be not women.</p>

<p>"Item, Because both men and women, that are
received into religious orders after the expiring of
their noviciat or probation-year, were constrained
and forced perpetually to stay there all the days of
their life, it was therefore ordered, that all whatever,
men or women, admitted within this abbey, should
have full leave to depart with peace and contentment,
whensoever it should seem good to them so to do.</p>

<p>"Item, for that the religious men and women
did ordinarily make three vows, to wit, those of
chastity, poverty, and obedience, it was therefore
constituted and appointed, that in this convent
they might be honourably married, that they might
be rich, and live at liberty.</p>

<p>"In regard of the legitimat time of the persons
to be initiated, and years under and above which
they were not capable of reception, the women were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to be admitted from ten till fifteen, and the men
from twelve till eighteen."<a name="FNanchor_241_244" id="FNanchor_241_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_244" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>After an elaborate description of the magnificence
of the abbey and of its endowments, and of the
apparel worn by the members of the new order, we
are told of "<i>how the Thelemites were governed, and of
their manner of living</i>." "All their life," we read,
"was spent not in lawes, statutes, or rules, but according
to their own free will and pleasure. They rose
out of their beds, when they thought good; they did
eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a minde to it,
and were disposed for it. None did awake them,
none did offer to constrain them to eat, drink, nor to
do any other thing; for so had Gargantua established
it. In all their rule, and strictest tie of their order,
there was but this one clause to be observed,</p>

<p>
DO WHAT THOU WILT;<br />
</p>

<p>Because men that are free, well-borne, well-bred,
and conversant in honest companies, have naturally
an instinct and spurre that prompteth them unto
vertuous actions, and withdraws them from vice,
which is called honour. Those same men when by
base subjection and constraint they are brought
under and kept down, turn aside from that noble
disposition, by which they formerly were inclined to
vertue, to shake off and break that bond of servitude,
wherein they are so tyrannously inslaved; for
it is agreeable with the nature of man to long after
things forbidden, and to desire what is denied us.<a name="FNanchor_242_245" id="FNanchor_242_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_245" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p>"By this liberty they entered into a very laudable
emulation, to do all of them what they saw
did please one. If any of the gallants or ladies
should say, Let us drink, they would all drink.
If any one of them said, Let us play, they all
played. If one said, Let us go a-walking into the
fields, they went all. If it were to go a-hawking
or a-hunting, the ladies mounted upon dainty, well-paced
nags, seated in a stately palfrey saddle,<a name="FNanchor_243_246" id="FNanchor_243_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_246" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
carried on their lovely fists, miniardly begloved
every one of them, either a sparhawk, or a laneret,
or a marlin, and the young gallants carried the
other kinds of hawkes. So nobly were they taught,
that there was neither he nor she amongst them
but could read, write, sing, play upon several
musical instruments, speak five or sixe several
languages, and compose in them all very quaintly,
both in verse and prose. Never were seen so
valiant knights, so noble and worthy, so dextrous
and skilful both on foot and a horseback, more
brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better
handling all manner of weapons then [than] were
there. Never were seene ladies so proper<a name="FNanchor_244_247" id="FNanchor_244_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_247" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and
handsome, so miniard and dainty, lesse froward, or
more ready with their hand, and with their needle,
in every honest and free action belonging to that
sexe, then [than] were there. For this reason,
when the time came, that any man of the said
abbey, either at the request of his parents, or for
some other cause, had a minde to go out of it, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
carried along with him one of the ladies, namely,
her whom he had before that chosen for his mistris,<a name="FNanchor_245_248" id="FNanchor_245_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_248" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
and [they] were married together. And if
they had formerly in Theleme lived in good devotion
and amity, they did continue therein and increase
it to a greater height in their state of matrimony:
and did entertaine that mutual love till the very
last day of their life, in no lesse vigour and fervency,
then [than] at the very day of their wedding."<a name="FNanchor_246_249" id="FNanchor_246_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_249" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Such is the dream which floated before the mind
of Rabelais, but, unhappily, it is still an airy fancy,
and has never received a local habitation and a
name. Mrs Grundy, the vegetarians, the teetotallers,
the anti-tobacco people, and the enemies of "rational
costume" have up to the present forbidden the
erection of any such building.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent figures in the story of
Pantagruel is his favourite, Panurge, who is a rogue,
a drunkard, a coward, and a malicious scoundrel, but
who yet, like Falstaff, in spite of all his moral deficiencies,
manages to appear as an amusing personage.
Into his lips is put, with a fine disregard of congruity,
an eloquent speech, which begins in praise of debt,
and ends by setting forth the interdependence of all
things in the universe. Panurge is represented as
having threescore and three ways of making money,
and two hundred and fourteen of spending it, so that
he is always poor, and his sovereign Pantagruel remonstrates
with him on account of his prodigal habits.</p>

<p>He replies as follows: "Be still indebted to some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>body
or other, that there may be somebody always
to pray for you; [to pray] that the giver of all
good things may grant unto you a blessed, long,
and prosperous life; fearing, if fortune should deal
crossly with you, that it might be his chance to
come short of being paid by you, he will always
speak good of you in every company, ever and
anon purchase new creditors unto you; to the end,
that through their means you may make a shift by
borrowing from Peter to pay Paul,<a name="FNanchor_247_250" id="FNanchor_247_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_250" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and with other
folk's earth fill up his ditch. When of old in the
region of the Gauls, by the institution of the
Druids,<a name="FNanchor_248_251" id="FNanchor_248_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_251" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> the servants, slaves, and bondmen were
burnt quick at the funerals and obsequies of their
lords and masters, had not they fear enough, think
you, that their lords and masters should die? For,
per force, they were to die with them for company.
Did not they uncessantly send up their supplications
to their great God Mercury,<a name="FNanchor_249_252" id="FNanchor_249_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_252" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> as likewise unto
Dis, the Father of Wealth,<a name="FNanchor_250_253" id="FNanchor_250_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_253" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> to lengthen out their
days, and preserve them long in health? Were
not they very careful to entertain them well,
punctually to look unto them, and to attend them
faithfully and circumspectly? For by those means
were they to live together at least until the hour
of death. Believe me your creditors with a more
fervent devotion will beseech [Providence] to pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>long
your life, they being of nothing more afraid
than that you should die.... I, in this only
respect and consideration of being a debtor, esteem
myself worshipful, reverend, and formidable. For,
against the opinion of most philosophers, that of
nothing ariseth nothing, yet, without having
bottomed on so much as that which is called the
First Matter [Primary Matter], did I out of nothing
become such [a] maker and creator, that I have
created&mdash;what?&mdash;a gay number of fair and jolly
creditors. Nay, creditors, I will maintain it, even
to the very fire itself exclusively,<a name="FNanchor_251_254" id="FNanchor_251_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_254" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> are fair and
goodly creatures. Who lendeth nothing is an
ugly and wicked creature.... You can hardly
imagine how glad I am, when every morning I
perceive myself environed and surrounded with
brigades of creditors,&mdash;humble, fawning, and full of
their reverences. And whilst I remark that, as I
look more favourably upon, and give a chearfuller
countenance to one than to the other, the fellow
thereupon buildeth a conceit that he shall be the first
dispatched, and the foremost in the date of payment;
and he valueth my smiles at the rate of
ready money.... I have all my lifetime held
debt to be as an union or conjunction of the
heavens with the earth, and the whole cement
whereby the race of mankind is kept together;<a name="FNanchor_252_255" id="FNanchor_252_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_255" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> yea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of such vertue and efficacy, that, I say, the whole progeny
of Adam would very suddenly perish without it."</p>

<p>He then goes on to describe a world in which
there are no debtors and no debts. There will be no
regular course among the planets, but all will be in
disorder. Jupiter, reckoning himself to be nothing
indebted to Saturn, will go near to thrust him out
of his place; Saturn and Mars will combine to
promote the confusion; Mercury, being debtor to
no one, will no longer serve any; Venus, because
she shall have lent nothing, will no longer be
venerated. "The moon," he says, "will remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
bloody and obscure. For to what end should the
sun impart unto her any of his light?<a name="FNanchor_253_256" id="FNanchor_253_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_256" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> He owed
her nothing. Nor yet will the sun shine upon the
earth, nor the stars send down any good influence,<a name="FNanchor_254_257" id="FNanchor_254_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_257" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
because the terrestrial globe hath desisted from
sending up their wonted nourishment by vapours
and exhalations, wherewith Heraclitus said, the
Stoicks proved, Cicero maintained, they were
cherished and alimented.... No rain will
descend upon the earth, nor light shine thereon;
no wind will blow there, nor will there be in it any
summer or harvest.... Such a world without
lending will be no better than a dog-kennel, a place
of contention and wrangling.... Men will not
then salute one another; it will be but lost labour
to expect aid or succour from any, or to cry fire,
water, murther, for none will put to their helping
hand. Why? He lent no money, there is nothing
due to him. Nobody is concerned in his burning,
in his shipwrack, in his ruine, or in his death; and
that because he hitherto hath lent nothing, and
would never thereafter have lent anything. In
short, Faith, Hope, and Charity would be quite
banish'd from such a world&mdash;for men are born to
relieve and assist one another."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p><p>"But, on the contrary," he went on to say, "be
pleased to represent unto your fancy another world,
wherein every one lendeth, and everyone oweth, all
are debtors, and all creditors. O how great will
that harmony be, which shall thereby result from
the regular motions of the heavens! Methinks I
hear it every whit as well as ever Plato did.<a name="FNanchor_255_258" id="FNanchor_255_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_258" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> What
sympathy will there be amongst the elements! O
how delectable then unto nature will be our own
works and productions! Whilst Ceres appeareth
loaden with corn, Bacchus with wines, Flora with
flowers, Pomona with fruits, and Juno fair in a
clear air, wholsom and pleasant. I lose myself in
this high contemplation. Then will among the
race of mankind, peace, love, benevolence, fidelity,
tranquillity, rests, banquets, feastings, joy, gladness,
gold, silver, single money [small change], chains,
rings, with other ware, and chaffer of that nature,
be found to trot from hand to hand. No suits at
law, no wars, no strife, debate, nor wrangling; none
will be there an usurer, none will be there a pinch-penny,
a scrape-good wretch, or churlish hard-hearted
refuser. Will not this be the golden age
in the reign of Saturn?&mdash;the true idea of the
Olympick regions, wherein all [other] vertues cease,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
charity alone ruleth, governeth, domineereth, and
triumpheth? All will be fair and goodly people

<p>In one curious passage Sir Thomas Urquhart
amplifies the text of the author whom he translates,
and supplies his readers with an astonishing
list of onomatop&#339;ic words, many of which will
probably be new to those who have not come across
this passage before. Rabelais has nine of these
words, but the translator<a name="FNanchor_257_260" id="FNanchor_257_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_260" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> enlarges the list to
seventy-one. Pantagruel is arguing against fasting
and solitude as aids to a contemplative
life, and quotes the authority of his father
Gargantua.</p>

<p>"He [Gargantua] gave us also," he said, "the
example of the philosopher, who, when he thought
most seriously to have withdrawn himself unto a
solitary privacy, far from the rusling clutterments
of the tumultuous and confused world, the better
to improve his theory, to contrive, comment, and
ratiocinate, was, notwithstanding his uttermost
endeavours to free himself from all untoward
noises, surrounded and environ'd about so with the
barking of currs [bawling of mastiffs, bleating of
sheep, prating of parrets, tatling of jack-daws,
grunting of swine, girning of boars, yelping of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
foxes, mewing of cats, cheeping of mice, squeaking
of weasils, croaking of frogs, crowing of cocks,
kekling of hens, calling of partridges, chanting of
swans, chattering of jays, peeping of chickens,
singing of larks, creaking of geese, chirping of
swallows, clucking of moorfowls, cucking of cuckos,
bumling of bees, rammage of hawks, chirming of
linots, croaking of ravens, screeching of owls,
whicking of pigs, gushing of hogs, curring of pigeons,
grumbling of cushet-doves, howling of panthers,
curkling of quails, chirping of sparrows, crackling
of crows, nuzzing of camels, wheening of whelps,
buzzing of dromedaries, mumbling of rabets, cricking
of ferrets, humming of wasps, mioling of tygers,
bruzzing of bears, sussing of kitnings, clamring of
scarfes, whimpring of fullmarts, boing of buffaloes,

was much more troubled than if he had been in
the middle of the crowd at the fair of Fontenay or
Niort."<a name="FNanchor_258_261" id="FNanchor_258_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_261" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> In spite of the amplification of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
original text of Rabelais, two of the sounds are
omitted&mdash;"the braying of asses," and the noise
made by grass-hoppers (<i>sonnent les eigales</i>), which
we might have called "chirping," if the swallows
and sparrows had not taken possession of that term.</p>

<p>As already stated, the first two books were all
that were published in the lifetime of Sir Thomas
Urquhart. They appeared as separate volumes in
1653. The unsold stock of each was reissued in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
1664, in one volume, an additional title-page, an
extra preface, and a life of Rabelais being prefixed
to them. The volume became very scarce, and in
1693-94 Pierre Antoine Motteux, a Frenchman,
who was master of exceedingly racy and idiomatic
English, published an edition containing the third
book. This was extremely inaccurate, so far as
typography was concerned, and gave the public the
version of Sir Thomas Urquhart with certain
unspecified changes made by the editor in order to
impart to it additional "smartness." In 1708
Motteux published a complete translation of
Rabelais, the version of the fourth and fifth books
being supplied by himself,<a name="FNanchor_259_262" id="FNanchor_259_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_262" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> as supplementary to
Urquhart's work. After the death of Motteux, a
somewhat pretentious editor named Ozell<a name="FNanchor_260_263" id="FNanchor_260_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_263" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> brought
out the combined versions, with notes principally
taken from the French of Duchat, and this has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
been reprinted time after time since its first
appearance in 1737.</p>

<p>At least seventeen editions of Urquhart's work,
either by itself or with Motteux's supplementary
matter, have been issued since his day, and there is
no sign of its fame waxing dim through the lapse of
time; and therefore the immortality after which he
longed has in a measure been won by him. And
so, once more before we take our leave of him, we
look again into the twilight of the past, and see
his striking figure&mdash;the soldier, the scholar, and
the author&mdash;crowned with the wreath which his
own hands have placed upon his brows, but which
succeeding generations declare him worthy to bear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

Urquhart's name, but on it is his motto ("Mean, speak, and do
well"). It runs as follows:&mdash;"The first Book of the Works of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Francis Rabelais</span>, Doctor in Physick: Containing Five Books of
the Lives, Heroick Deeds, and Sayings of <span class="smcap">Gargantua</span> and his
Sonne <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span>. Together with the Pantagrueline Prognostication,
the Oracle of the divine Bacbuc, and response of the bottle.
Hereunto are annexed the Navigations unto the sounding Isle and
the Isle of the Apedefts: as likewise the Philosophical cream with
a Limosin Epistle. All done by Mr. Francis Rabelais, in the
French Tongue, and now faithfully translated into English. &#949;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#953;

within the Middle Templegate. 1653." On the title-page of the
second book are the translator's initials, S, T. V. C. (Sir Thomas
Urquhart of Cromartie). While on that of the third book we have
his name in full: "Now faithfully translated into English by the
unimitable pen of Sir Thomas Urwhart, Kt. and Bar. The Translator of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the Two First Books. Never before Printed. London:</span><br />
Printed for Richard Baldwin, near the Oxford Arms in Warwick
Lane, 1693." Copies of the first and second books of the above
date are in the British Museum, but erroneously catalogued&mdash;not
under Urquhart, but only under C., S. T. V. A second edition of
them both seems from the Bodleian Catalogue to have been published
in 1664. Both are very rare, it is said, owing to the
destruction caused by the fire of London in 1666.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_233_236" id="Footnote_233_236"></a><a href="#FNanchor_233_236"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> For those who are not special students, adequate information
concerning Rabelais and extracts from his works are to be got in
Sir Walter Besant's luminous and charming volume in the series of
Foreign Classics for English Readers (Blackwood), and in Morley's
<i>Universal Library</i> (Routledge). In one of his poems Browning
describes the steps taken by a reader to banish the memory of a
dreary pedant, whose book he had been perusing. He says:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then I went indoors, brought out a loaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half a cheese, and a bottle of Chablis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay on the grass, and forgot the loaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over a jolly chapter of Rabelais."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Some have turned over Rabelais and searched for the jolly chapter
in vain, and have, perhaps, attributed their failure to the want of
a bottle of Chablis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_234_237" id="Footnote_234_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_234_237"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> This is somewhat doubtful. The Sorbonne and the Parliaments
might have been moved by ultra-orthodox opponents to prosecute
Rabelais on this account. The true explanation seems to be that
the form of his book was popular, and the popular French literature
of the Middle Ages&mdash;fableaux, farces, and burlesque romances&mdash;can
hardly be exceeded in the matter of coarseness (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>,
"Rabelais").</p></div>

some points of the "<i>Nonconformist Conscience</i>." The fact alluded

by the above chapter in Rabelais. "The World is maintained
by Intercourse; and the whole Course of Nature is a great
Exchange, in which one good Turn is and ought to be the stated
Price of another. If you consider the Universe as one Body, you
shall find Society and Conversation to supply the Office of the
Blood and Spirits; and it is Gratitude that makes them circulate.
Look over the whole Creation, and you shall see that the Band or
Cement that holds together all the Parts of this great and glorious
Fabric is Gratitude, or something like it: you may observe it in
all the Elements, for does not the Air feed the Flame? and does not
the Flame at the same time warm and enlighten the Air? Is not
the Sea always sending forth, as well as taking in? And does not
the Earth quit scores with all the Elements, in the noble Fruits
and Productions that issue from it? And in all the Light and
Influence that the Heavens bestow upon this lower World, though
the lower World cannot equal their Benefaction, yet with a Kind
of grateful Return, it reflects those Rays that it cannot recompense:
so that there is some Return however, though there can be no
Requital.... In short, Gratitude is the great Spring that sets all
the Wheels of Nature agoing; and the whole Universe is supported
by giving and returning, by Commerce and Commutation. And
now, thou ungrateful Brute, thou Blemish to Mankind, and
Reproach to thy Creation; what shall we say of thee, or to what
shall we compare thee? For thou art an Exception from all the
visible World; neither the Heavens above nor the Earth beneath
afford anything like thee: and therefore, if thou wouldest find thy
Parallel, go to Hell, which is both the Region and the Emblem of
Ingratitude; for besides thyself, there is nothing but Hell that
is always receiving and never restoring" (I. <span class="smcap">Serm.</span> xi. "<i>Of the
odious Sin of Ingratitude</i>").</p></div>

heard. He adopts the theory to some extent from the Pythagoreans.
Aristotle (<i>de Coelo</i>, ii. 9), that the noise caused by
the movements of the heavenly bodies is so prodigious and
continuous, that, being accustomed to it from our birth, we do not
notice it. The only notice in Plato that can be construed into a
statement about audible music of the spheres is in <i>Rep.</i> x.,
where he speaks of a siren standing upon each of the circles of the
planetary system uttering one note in one tone; and from all the
eight notes there results a single harmony (F. W. S.).</p></div>

<i>Niort</i> were noted for their busy yearly fairs. There can be doubt
that the above passage was suggested to Rabelais by what St Jerome
records of the experience of St Hilarion in the desert. "Sic attentuatus,"
he says, "[jejunio et vigiliis], et in tantum exeto corpore, ut
ossibus vix haereret, quadam nocte c&#339;pit infantum audire vagitus,
balatus pecorum, mugitus boum, planctum quasi mulierum, leonum
rugitus, murmur exercitus, et prorsus variarum portenta vocum,"
etc. (<i>Vita Sancti Hilarionis</i>). In Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>
(iii. 4. 1. 2) there is the following reference to the same
passage: "Monks, Anachorites, and the like, after much emptiness
become melancholy, vertiginous, they think they hear
strange noises, confer with Hob-goblins, Devils.... <i>Hilarion</i>,
as <i>Hierome</i> reports in his life, and <i>Athanasius of Antonius</i>, was so
bare with fasting, <i>that the skin did scarce stick to the bones</i>; for
want of vapours (<i>sic</i>) he could not sleep, and for want of sleep
became idle-headed, <i>heard every night infants cry, Oxen low,
Wolves howl, Lions roar (as he thought), clattering of chains,
strange voices, and the like illusions of Devils</i>." It is probable
also that Rabelais had read the following passage in the <i>Life of
Geta</i>, by &AElig;lius Spartianus (c. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 317): "Familiare illi fuit
has qu&aelig;stiones grammaticis proponere, ut dicerent, singula
animalia quomodo vocem emitterent, velut, Agni balant, porcelli
grumniunt, palumbes minurriunt, ursi saeviunt, leones rugiunt,
leopardi rictant, elephanti barriunt, ran&aelig; coaxant, equi hinniunt,
asini rudunt, tauri mugiunt, easque de veteribus approbare." Nor
is it likely that Rabelais was unacquainted with the verses in Teofilo
Folengo's (1491-1544) <i>Merlini Cocaii Macaronicon</i>, which run thus:

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_259_262" id="Footnote_259_262"></a><a href="#FNanchor_259_262"><span class="label">[259]</span></a> In the introduction to this volume Motteux says that Sir
Thomas Urquhart was "a learned physician." It is difficult to
understand what could have given rise to such a statement. Sir
Thomas had many projects for the benefit of the human race, but
there is no evidence of his ever having cherished that of combating
disease. One cannot help thinking of the magniloquent terms in
which he would have extolled his remedies, if the fates had led
him to the concoction of patent medicines. It is doubtful, however,
whether he would have had what is technically known as "a
good bed-side manner." It is quite possible that Motteux simply
meant that Sir Thomas was well acquainted with medical science,
and not that he was a physician by profession. Yet his words
have often been understood as asserting the latter. Thus we find
the erroneous statement in Granger's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>,
the Amsterdam (1741) edition of Rabelais, and Sir John Hawkins'
<i>Life of Johnson</i>, p. 294.</p></div>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_II" id="APPENDIX_II"></a>APPENDIX II</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Admirable Crichton</span> (p. 157).</p>


<p>"To speak a little now of his compatriot Crichtoun,
I hope will not offend the ingenuous reader; who
may know, by what is already displayed, that it
cannot be heterogeneal from the proposed purpose,
to make report of that magnanimous act atchieved
by him at the Duke of Mantua's court, to the honour
not only of his own, but to the eternal renown also
of the whole Isle of Britain; the manner whereof
was thus:</p>

<p>"A certain Italian gentleman, of a mighty, able,
strong, nimble, and vigorous body, by nature fierce,
cruell, warlike, and audacious, and in the gladiatory
art so superlatively expert and dextrous, that all the
most skilful teachers of Escrime, and fencing-masters
of Italy, (which in matter of choice professors in that
faculty, needed never as yet to yeild to any nation
in the world), were by him beaten to their good
behaviour, and by blows given in, which they could
not avoid, enforced to acknowledge him their over
comer; bethinking himself, how, after so great a
conquest of reputation, he might by such means be
very suddenly enriched, he projected a course of exchanging
the blunt to sharp, and the foiles into
tucks. And in this resolution providing a purse
full of gold, worth neer upon four hundred pounds
English money, traveled alongst the most especial
and considerable parts of Spaine, France, the Low-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>Countryes,
Germany, Pole, Hungary, Greece, Italy,
and other places, where ever there was greatest
probability of encountring with the eagerest and
most atrocious duellists. And immediately after his
arrival to any city or town that gave apparent likelihood
of some one or other champion that would enter
the lists and cope with him, he boldly challenged them
with sound of trumpet, in the chief market-place, to
adventure an equal sum of money against that of
his, to be disputed at the sword's point who should
have both. There failed not several brave men,
almost of all nations, who, accepting of his cartels, were
not afraid to hazard both their person and coine
against him; but, (till he midled with this Crichtoun),
so maine was the ascendant he had above all his
antagonists, and so unlucky the fate of such as
offered to scuffle with him, that all his opposing
combatants, (of what state or dominion soever they
were), who had not lost both their life and gold, were
glad, for the preservation of their person, (though
sometimes with a great expence of blood), to leave both
their reputation and mony behind them. At last,
returning homewards to his own country, loaded with
honor and wealth, or rather the spoils of the reputation
of those forraginers, whom the Italians call Tramontani,
he, by the way, after his accustomed manner
of abording other places, repaired to the city of
Mautua, where the Duke, (according to the courtesie
usually bestowed on him by other princes), vouchsafed
him a protection and savegard for his person;
he (as formerly he was wont to do, by beat of drum,
sound of trumpet, and several printed papers, disclosing
his designe, battered on all the chief gates, posts,
and pillars of the town), gave all men to understand,
that his purpose was to challenge, at the single
rapier, any whosoever of that city or country, that
durst be so bold as to fight with him, provided he
would deposite a bag of five hundred Spanish pistols<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
over against another of the same value, which he
himself should lay down, upon this condition, that
the enjoyment of both should be the conqueror's
due. His challenge was not long unanswered, for
it happened, at the same time, that three of the most
notable cutters in the world, (and so highly cryed up
for valour, that all the bravos of the land were
content to give way to their domineering, how
insolent soever they should prove, because of their
former constantly obtained victories in the field),
were all three together at the court of Mantua, who,
hearing of such a harvest of five hundred pistols to
be reaped, (as they expected), very soon, and with
ease, had almost contested amongst themselves for
the priority of the first encounterer, but that one of
my Lord Duke's courtiers moved them to cast lots
for who should be first, second, and third, in case
none of the former two should prove victorious.
Without more adoe, he whose chance it was to
answer the cartel with the first defiance, presented
himself within the barriers, or place appointed for
the fight, where, his adversary attending him, as soon
as the trumpet sounded a charge, they jointly fel to
work; and, (because I am not now to amplifie the
particulars of a combat), although the dispute was
very hot for a while, yet, whose fortune it was to be
first of the three in the field, had the disaster to be
first of the three that was foyled; for, at last, with
a thrust in the throat, he was killed dead upon the
ground. This, nevertheless, not a whit dismayed the
other two, for, the nixt day, he that was second in
the roll gave his appearance after the same manner
as the first had done, but with no better success; for
he likewise was laid flat dead upon the place, by
means of a thrust he received in the heart. The last
of the three, finding that he was as sure of being
engaged in the fight as if he had been the first in
order, pluckt up his heart, knit his spirits together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and, all the day after the death of the second, most
couragiously entering the lists, demeaned himself for
a while with great activity and skill; but at last, his
luck being the same with those that preceded him,
by a thrust in the belly, he within four and twenty
hours after gave up the ghost. These (you may
imagine), were lamentable spectacles to the Duke and
citie of Mantua, who, casting down their faces for
shame, knew not what course to take for reparation
of their honour. The conquering duellist, proud of
a victory so highly tending to both his honour and
profit, for the space of a whole fortnight, or two
weeks together, marched daily along the streets of
Mantua, (without any opposition or controulment),
like another Romulus or Marcellus in triumph;
which, the never too much to be admired Crichtoun
perceiving, to wipe off the imputation of cowardise
lying upon the court of Mantua, to which he had
but even then arrived, (although formerly he had
been a domestick thereof), he could neither eat nor
drink till he had first sent a challenge to the conqueror,
appelling him to repair with his best sword
in his hand, by nine of the clock in the morning of
the next day, in presence of the whole court, and in
the same place where he had killed the other three,
to fight with him upon this quarrel, that in the court
of Mantua there were as valiant men as he; and, for
his better encouragement to the desired undertaking,
he assured him that, to the aforesaid five hundred
pistols, he would adjoyn a thousand more, wishing
him to do the like, that the victor, upon the point of
his sword, might carry away the richer bootay. The
challenge, with all its conditions, is no sooner accepted
of, the time and place mutually condescended upon,
kept accordingly, and the fifteen hundred pistols
<i>hinc inde</i> deposited, but of the two rapiers of equal
weight, length, and goodness, each taking one, in
presence of the Duke, Dutchess, with all the noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>men,
ladies, magnificos, and all the choicest of men,
women, and maids of that citie, as soon as the signal
for the duel was given, by the shot of a great piece
of ordnance of threescore and four pound ball, the
combatants, with a lion-like animosity, made their
approach to one another, and, being within distance,
the valiant Crichtoun, to make his adversary spend his
fury the sooner, betook himself to the defensive part;
wherein, for a long time, he shewed such excellent
dexterity in warding the other's blows, slighting his
falsifyings, in breaking measure, and often, by the
agility of his body, avoiding his thrust, that he
seemed but to play, while the other was in earnest.
The sweetness of Crichtoun's countenance, in the
hotest of the assault, like a glance of lightning on
the hearts of the spectators, brought all the Italian
ladies on a sudden to be enamoured of him; whilst
the sternness of the other's aspect, he looking like an
enraged bear, would have struck terrour into wolves,
and affrighted an English mastiff. Though they
were both in their linens, (to wit, shirts and drawers,
without any other apparel), and in all outward conveniences
equally adjusted, the Italian, with redoubling
his stroaks, foamed at the mouth with a
cholerick heart, and fetched a pantling breath; the
Scot, in sustaining his charge, kept himself in a
pleasant temper, without passion, and made void his
designes; he alters his wards from tierce to quart;
he primes and seconds it, now high, now lowe, and
casts his body, (like another Prothee), into all the
shapes he can, to spie an open on his adversary, and
lay hold of an advantage, but all in vain; for the
invincible Crichtoun, whom no cunning was able to
surprise, contrepostures his respective wards, and,
with an incredible nimbleness of both hand and foot,
evades the intent and frustrates the invasion. Now
is it, that the never before conquered Italian, finding
himself a little faint, enters into a consideration that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
he may be over-matched; whereupon a sad apprehension
of danger seizing upon all his spirits, he
would gladly have his life bestowed on him as a gift,
but that, having never been accustomed to yield,
he knows not how to beg it. Matchless Crichtoun,
seeing it now high time to put a gallant catastrophe
to that so long dubious combat, animated with a
divinely inspired servencie to fulfil the expectation
of the ladies, and crown the Duke's illustrious hopes,
changeth his garb, falls to act another part, and,
from defender, turn assailant; never did art so grace
nature, nor nature second the precepts of art with so
much liveliness, and such observancie of time, as
when, after he had struck fire out of the steel of his
enemie's sword, and gained the feeble thereof with
the fort of his own, by angles of the strongest position,
he did, by geometrical flourishes of straight and
oblique lines, so practically execute the speculative
part, that, as if there had been Remoras and secret
charms in the variety of his motion, the fierceness of
his foe was in a trice transqualified into the numbness
of a pageant. Then was it that, to vindicate the reputation
of the Duke's family, and expiate the blood
of the three vanquished gentlemen, he alonged a
stoccade <i>de pied ferme</i>; then recoyling, he advanced
another thrust, and lodged it home; after which,
retiring again, his right foot did beat the cadence of
the blow that pierced the belly of this Italian, whose
heart and throat being hit with the two former
stroaks, these three franch bouts given in upon the
back of the other; besides that, if lines were imagined
drawn from the hand that livered them, to the places
which were marked by them, they would represent a
perfect isosceles triangle, with a perpendicular from
the top angle cutting the basis in the middle; they
likewise give us to understand, that by them he was
to be made a sacrifice of atonement for the slaughter
of the three aforesaid gentlemen, who were wounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in the very same parts of their bodies by other such
three venees as these, each whereof being mortal;
and his vital spirits exhaling as his blood gushed out,
all he spoke was this, That seeing he could not live,
his comfort in dying was, that he could not dye by
the hand of a braver man; after the uttering of
which words, he expiring, with the shril clarcens of
trumpets, bouncing thunder of artillery, bethwacked
beating of drums, universal clapping of hands, and
loud acclamations of joy for so glorious a victory, the
aire above them was so rarified by the extremity of
the noise and vehement sound, dispelling the thickest
and most condensed parts thereof, that (as Plutarch
speakes of the Grecians, when they raised their shouts
of allegress up to the very heavens at the hearing of
the gracious proclamations of Paulus &AElig;milius in
favour of their liberty), the very sparrows and other
flying fowls were said to fall to the ground for want
of aire enough to uphold them in their flight.</p>

<p>"When this sudden rapture was over, and all husht
into its former tranquility, the noble gallantry and
generosity, beyond expression, of the inimitable
Crichtoun, did transport them all againe into a new
exstasie of ravishment, when they saw him like an
angel in the shape of a man, or as another Mars,
with the conquered enemie's sword in one hand, and
the fifteen hundred pistols he had gained in the
other, present the sword to the Duke as his due,
and the gold to his high treasurer, to be disponed
equally to the three widows of the three unfortunate
gentlemen lately slaine, reserving only to himself
the inward satisfaction he conceived, for having so
opportunely discharged his duty to the House of
Mantua.</p>

<p>"The reader perhaps will think this wonderful; and
so would I too, were it not that I know, (as Sir Philip
Sydney sayes), that a wonder is no wonder in a wonderful
subject, and consequently not in him, who for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
his learning, judgement, valour, eloquence, beauty,
and good-fellowship was the perfectest result of the
joynt labour of the perfect number of those six
deities, Pallas, Apollo, Mars, Mercury, Venus, and
Bacchus, that hath been seen since the dayes of
Alcibiades; for he was reported to have been inriched
with a memory so prodigious, that any sermon,
speech, harangue, or other manner of discourse of an
hour's continuance, he was able to recite without
hesitation, after the same manner of gesture and
pronuntiation in all points, wherewith it was delivered
at first; and of so stupendious a judgment
and conception, that almost naturally he understood
quiddities of philosophy; and as for the abstrusest
and most researched mysteries of other disciplines,
arts, and faculties, the intentional species of them
were as readily obvious to the interiour view and perspicacity
of his mind, as those of the common visible
colours to the external sight of him that will open
his eyes to look upon them; of which accomplishment
and Encyclopedia of knowledge, he gave on a
time so marvelous a testimony at Paris, that the
words of <i>Admirabilis Scotus</i>, the Wonderful Scot, in
all the several tongues and idiomes of Europ, were,
(for a great while together), by the most of the echos
resounded to the peircing of the very clouds. To so
great a hight and vast extent of praise did the never
too much to be extolled reputation of the seraphick
wit of that eximious man attaine, for his commanding
to be affixed programs on all the gates of the
schooles, halls, and colledges of that famous university,
as also on all the chief pillars and posts standing
before the houses of the most renowned men for
literature, resident within the precinct of the walls
and suburbs of that most populous and magnificent
city, inviting them all, (or any whoever else versed in
any kinde of scholastick faculty), to repaire at nine of
the clock in the morning of such a day, moneth, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
yeer, as by computation came to be just six weeks
after the date of the affixes, to the common schoole
of the colledge of Navarre,<a name="FNanchor_261_264" id="FNanchor_261_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_264" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> where, (at the prefixed
time), he should, (God willing), be ready to answer to
what should be propounded to him concerning any
science, liberal art, discipline, or faculty, practical or
theoretick, not excluding the theological nor jurisprudential
habits, though grounded but upon the
testimonies of God and man, and that in any of these
twelve languages,<a name="FNanchor_262_265" id="FNanchor_262_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_265" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Hebrew, Syriack, Arabick, Greek,
Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, English, Dutch,
Flemish, and Sclavonian, in either verse or prose, at
the discretion of the disputant; which high enterprise
and hardy undertaking, by way of challenge to the
learndst men in the world, damped the wits of many
able scholars to consider whether it was the attempt
of a fanatick spirit, or lofty designe of a well-poised
judgment; yet after a few days enquiry concerning
him, when information was got of his incomparable
endowments, all the choicest and most profound
philosophers, mathematicians, naturalists, mediciners,
alchymists, apothecaries, surgeons, doctors of both
civil and canon law, and divines both for controversies
and positive doctrine, together with the primest
grammarians, rhetoricians, logicians, and others,
professors of other arts and disciplines at Paris,
plyed their studys in their private cels for the space
of a moneth, exceeding hard, and with huge paines
and labor set all their braines awork how to contrive
the knurriest arguments, and most difficult questions
could be devised, thereby to puzzle him in the resolving
of them, meander him in his answers, put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
him out of his medium, and drive him to a <i>non plus</i>;
nor did they forget to premonish the ablest there of
forraign nations not to be unprepared to dispute
with him in their own material dialects, and that
sometimes metrically, sometimes otherwayes, <i>pro
libitu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_263_266" id="FNanchor_263_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_266" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> All this while the Admirable Scot, (for so
from thenceforth he was called), minding more his
hawking, hunting, tilting, vaulting, riding of well-managed
horses, tossing of the pike, handling of the
musket, flourishing of colours, dancing, fencing, swimming,
jumping, throwing of the bar, playing at tennis,
baloon, or long catch; and sometimes at the house
games of dice, cards, playing at the chess, billiards,
trou-madam, and other such like chamber sports,
singing, playing on the lute and other musical instruments,
masking, balling, reveling; and, which did most
of all divert, or rather distract him from his speculations
and serious employments, being more addicted
to, and plying closer the courting of handsome ladyes,
and a jovial cup in the company of bacchanalian
blades, then [than] the forecasting how to avoid,
shun, and escape the snares, grins [gins?], and nets
of the hard, obscure, and hidden arguments, ridles,
and demands, to be made, framed, and woven by the
professors, doctors, and others of that thrice-renowned
university. There arose upon him an aspersion of
too great proness to such like debordings and youthful
emancipations, which occasioned one less acquainted
with himself then [than] his reputation, to
subjoyn, (some two weeks before the great day
appointed), to that program of his, which was fixed
on the Sorbone gate, these words: 'If you would
meet with this monster of perfection, to make search
for him ... in the taverne ... is the reedyest way
to finde him.' By reason of which expression,
(though truly as I think, both scandalous and false),
the eminent sparks of the university, (imagining that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
those papers of provocation had been set up to no
other end, but to scoff and delude them, in making
them waste their spirits upon quirks and quiddities,
more then [than] was fitting), did resent a little of
their former toyle, and slack their studyes, becoming
almost regardless thereof, till the several peals of
bells ringing an hour or two before the time assigned,
gave warning that the party was not to flee the
barriers, nor decline the hardship of academical
assaults; but, on the contrary, so confident in his
former resolution, that he would not shrink to sustaine
the shock of all their disceptations. This
sudden alarm so awaked them out of their last fortnight's
lethargy, that, calling to minde, the best way
they might, the fruits of the foregoing moneth's
labour, they hyed to the forenamed schoole with all
diligence; where, after all of them had, according to
their several degrees and qualities, seated themselves,
and that by reason of the noise occasioned through
the great confluence of people, which so strange a
novelty brought thither out of curiosity, an universal
silence was commanded, the Orator of the University,
in most fluent Latine, addressing his speech to
Crichtoun, extolled him for his literature, and other
good parts, and for that confident opinion he had of
his own sufficiency, in thinking himself able to justle
in matters of learning with the whole university of
Paris, Crichtoun answering him in no less eloquent
terms of Latine, after he had most heartily thanked
him for his elegies, so undeservedly bestowed, and
darted some high encomiums upon the university
and the professors therein; he very ingeniously
[ingenuously] protested that he did not emit his
programs out of any ambition to be esteemed able to
enter in competition with the university, but meerly
to be honoured with the favour of a publick conference
with the learned men thereof. In complements
after this manner, <i>ultro citroque habitis</i>, tossed to and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
again, retorted, contrerisposted, backreverted, and
now and then graced with a quip or a clinch for the
better relish of the ear, being unwilling in this kind
of straining curtesie to yeeld to other, they spent a
full half hour and more; for he being the centre to
which the innumerable diameters of the discourses
of that circulary convention did tend, although none
was to answer but he, any of them all, according to
the order of their prescribed series, were permitted
to reply, or commence new motions on any subject,
in what language soever, and howsoever expressed;
to all which, he being bound to tender himself a
respondent, in matter and form suitable to the impugners
propounding, he did first so transcendently
acquit himself of that circumstantial kinde of oratory,
that, by well-couched periods, and neatly running
syllables, in all the twelve languages, both in verse
and prose, he expressed to the life his courtship
[courtliness] and civility; and afterwards, when the
Rector of the university, (unwilling to have any more
time bestowed on superficial rhetorick, or to have
that wasted on the fondness of quaint phrases, which
might be better employed in a reciprocacy of discussing
scientifically the nature of substantial things),
gave direction to the professors to fall on, each
according to the dignity or precedency of his faculty,
and that conform to the order given. Some metaphysical
notions were set abroach, then mathematical,
and of those arithmetical, geometrical, astronomical,
musical, optical, cosmographical, trigonometrical,
statical, and so forth through all the other branches
of the prime and mother sciences thereof; the next
bout was through all natural philosophy, according
to Aristotle's method, from the acroamaticks, going
along the speculation of the nature of the heavens,
and that of the generation and corruption of sublinary
things, even to the consideration of the soul
and its faculties; in sequel hereof, they had a hint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
at chymical extractions, and spoke of the principles
of corporeal and mixed bodies, according to the precepts
of that art. After this, they disputed of
medicine, in all its thereapeutick, pharmacopeutick,
and chirurgical parts; and not leaving natural magick
untouched, they had exquisite disceptations concerning
the secrets thereof. From thence they proceeded
to moral philosophy, where, debating of the true
enumeration of all vertues and vices, they had most
learned ratiocinations about the chief good of the life
of man; and seeing the [that] &#339;cumenicks and
politicks are parts of that philosophy, they argued
learnedly of all the several sorts of governments,
with their defects and advantages; whereupon perpending,
that, without an established law, all the
duties of ruling and subjection, to the utter ruin of
humane society, would be as often violated as the
irregularity of passion, seconded with power, should
give way thereto. The Sorbonist, canonical, and
civilian doctors most judiciously argued with him
about the most prudential maximes, sentences, ordinances,
acts, and statutes for ordering all manner of
persones in their consciences, bodyes, fortunes, and
reputation; nor was there an end put to those
literate exercitations till the grammarians, rhetoricians,
poets, and logicians had assailed him with all
the subtleties and nicest quodlibets their respective
habits could afford. Now when, to the admiration
of all that were there, the incomparable Crichtoun
had, in all these faculties above written, and in any
of the twelve languages wherein he was spoke to,
whether in verse or prose, held tack to all the disputants,
who were accounted the ablest scholars
upon earth in each their own profession; and publickly
evidenced such an universality of knowledge,
and accurate promptness in resolving of doubts, distinguishing
of obscurities, expressing the members
of a distinction in adequate terms of art, explaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
those compendious tearms with words of a more
easie apprehension to the prostrating of the sublimest
mysteries to any vulgar capacity, and with all
excogitable variety of learning, (to his own everlasting
fame), entertained, after that kinde, the nimble witted
Parisians from nine o'clock in the morning till six
at night; the Rector now finding it high time to give
some relaxation to these worthy spirits, which, during
such a long space, had been so intensively bent
upon the abstrusest speculations, rose up, and saluting
the divine Crichtoun, after he had made an elegant
panegyrick, or encomiastick speech of half an houre's
continuance, tending to nothing else but the extolling
of him for the rare and most singular gifts wherewith
God and nature had endowed him, he descended
from his chaire, and, attended by three or four of
the most especial professors, presented him with a
diamond ring and a purse ful of gold, wishing him to
accept thereof, if not, as a recompense proportional
to his merit, yet as a badge of love, and testimony of
the universitie's favour towards him. At the tender
of which ceremony, there was so great a plaudite in
the schoole, such a humming and clapping of hands,
that all the concavities of the colledges there about
did resound with the echo of the noise thereof.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the great honor thus purchased
by him for his literatory accomplishments, and that
many excellent spirits, to obteine the like, would be
content to postpose all other employments to the
enjoyment of their studyes, he, nevertheless, the very
next day, (to refresh his braines, as he said, for the
toile of the former day's work), went to the Louvre in
a buff-suit, more like a favourite of Mars then [than]
one of the Muses' minions; where, in presence of
some princes of the court, and great ladies, that
came to behold his gallantry, he carryed away the
ring fifteen times on end, and broke as many lances
on the Saracen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"When for a quarter of a yeer together he after
this manner had disported himself, (what martially,
what scholastically), with the best qualified men in
any faculty so ever, that so large a city, (which is
called the world's abridgement), was able to afford,
and now and then solaced these his more serious
recreations, (for all was but sport to him), with the
alluring imbellishments of the tendrer sexe, whose
<i>inamorato</i> that he might be, was their ambition; he
on a sudden took resolution to leave the Court of
France, and return to Italy, where he had been bred
for many yeers together; which designe he prosecuting
within the space of a moneth, (without
troubling himself with long journeys), he arrived at
the Court of Mantua, where immediately after his
abord, (as hath been told already), he fought the
memorable combat whose description is above
related. Here it was that the learned and valiant
Crichtoun was pleased to cast anchor, and fix his
abode; nor could he almost otherwise do, without
disobliging the Duke, and the Prince his eldest son;
by either whereof he was so dearly beloved, that
none of them would permit him by any means to
leave their Court, whereof he was the only <i>privado</i>,
the object of all men's love, and subject of their
discourse; the example of the great ones, and
wonder of the meaner people; the paramour of the
female sexe, and paragon of his own. In the glory
of which high estimation, having resided at that
Court above two whole yeers, the reputation of
gentlemen there was hardly otherwayes valued but
by the measure of his acquaintance; nor were the
young unmaryed ladies, of all the most eminent
places thereabouts, any thing respected of one
another, that had not either a lock of his hair, or
copy of verses of his composing. Nevertheless it
happening on a Shrove-tuesday at night, (at which
time it is in Italy very customary for men of great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
sobriety, modesty, and civil behaviour all the rest of
the yeer, to give themselves over on that day of
carnavale, as they call it, to all manner of riot,
drunkenness, and incontinency, which that they may
do with the least imputation they can to their credit,
they go maskt and mum'd with vizards on their faces,
and in the disguise of a Zanni or Pantaloon, to
ventilate their fopperies, and sometimes intolerable
enormities, without suspicion of being known), that
this ever renowned Crichtoun, (who, in the afternoon
of that day, at the desire of my Lord Duke, the
whole court striving which should exceed each other
in foolery, and devising of the best sports to excite
laughter, neither my Lord, the Dutchess, nor Prince,
being exempted from acting their parts, as well as
they could), upon a theater set up for the purpose,
begun to prank it, <i>&agrave; la Venetiana</i>, with such a
flourish of mimick and ethopoetick gestures, that all
the courtiers of both sexes, even those that a little
before were fondest of their own conceits, at the sight
of his so inimitable a garb, from ravishing actors that
they were before, turned them ravished spectators.
O with how great liveliness did he represent the conditions
of all manner of men! how naturally did he
set before the eyes of the beholders the rogueries of
all professions, from the overweening monarch to the
peevish swaine, through all the intermediate degrees
of the superficial courtier or proud warrior, dissembled
churchman, doting old man, cozening lawyer,
lying traveler, covetous merchant, rude seaman,
pedantick scholar, the amourous shepheard, envious
artisan, vainglorious master, and tricky servant; he
did with such variety display the several humours of
all these sorts of people, and with a so bewitching
energy, that he seemed to be the original, they the
counterfeit; and they the resemblance whereof he
was the prototype. He had all the jeers, squibs,
flouts, buls, quips, taunts, whims, jests, clinches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
gybes, mokes, jerks, with all the several kinds of
equivocations, and other sophistical captions, that
could properly be adapted to the person by whose
representation he intended to inveagle the company
into a fit of mirth; and would keep in that miscelany
discourse of his, (which was all for the splene, and
nothing for the gall), such a climacterical and mercurially
digested method, that when the fancy of the
hearers was tickled with any rare conceit, and that
the jovial blood was moved, he held it going with
another new device upon the back of the first, and
another, yet another, and another againe, succeeding
one another for the promoval of what is a-stirring
into a higher agitation; till in the closure of the
luxuriant period, the decumanal wave of the oddest
whimsy of all, enforced the charmed spirits of the
auditory, (for affording room to its apprehension),
suddenly to burst forth into a laughter, which
commonly lasted just so long as he had leisure to
withdraw behind the skreen, shift off, with the help
of a page, the suite he had on, apparel himself with
another, and return to the stage to act afresh; for
by that time their transported, disparpled, and
sublimated fancies, by the wonderfully operating
engines of his solacious inventions, had from the
hight to which the inward scrues, wheeles, and pullies
of his wit had elevated them, descended by degrees
into their wonted stations, he was ready for the
personating of another carriage; whereof to the
number of fourteen several kinds, (during the five
hours space that at the Duke's desire, the solicitation
of the court, and his own recreation, he was pleased
to histrionize it), he shewed himself so natural a
representative, that any would have thought he had
been so many several actors, differing in all things
else, save only the stature of the body; with this
advantage above the most of other actors, whose
tongue, with its oral implements, is the onely instru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>ment
of their minds' disclosing, that, besides his
mouth with its appurtenances, he lodged almost a
several oratour in every member of his body; his
head, his eyes, his shoulder, armes, hands, fingers,
thighs, legs, feet, and breast, being able to decipher
any passion whose character he purposed to give.</p>

<p>"First, he did present himself with a crown on his
head, a scepter in his hand, being clothed in a purple
robe furred with ermyne; after that, with a miter on
his head, a crosier in his hand, and accoutred with a
paire of lawn-sleeves; and thereafter, with a helmet
on his head, the visiere up, a commanding stick in
his hand, and arayed in a buff-suit, with a scarf
about his middle. Then, in a rich apparel, after the
newest fashion, did he shew himself, (like another
Sejanus), with a periwig daubed with Cypres powder;
in sequel of that, he came out with a three-corner'd
cap on his head, some parchments in his hand, and
writings hanging at his girdle like Chancery bills;
and next to that, with a furred gown about him, an
ingot of gold in his hand, and a bag full of money by
his side; after all this, he appeares againe clad in a
country-jacket, with a prong in his hand, and a
Monmouth-like-cap on his head; then very shortly
after, with a palmer's coat upon him, a bourdon in
his hand,<a name="FNanchor_264_267" id="FNanchor_264_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_267" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and some few cockle-shels stuck to his
hat, he look'd as if he had come in pilgrimage from
St Michael; immediately after that, he domineers
it in a bare unlined gown, with a pair of whips in the
one hand, and Corderius in the other; and in suite
thereof, he honderspondered<a name="FNanchor_265_268" id="FNanchor_265_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_268" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> it with a pair of
pannier-like breeches, a mountera-cap on his head,
and a knife in a wooden sheath dagger-ways by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
side; about the latter end, he comes forth again with
a square in one hand, a rule in the other, and a
leather apron before him; then very quickly after,
with a scrip by his side, a sheep-hook in his hand,
and a basket full of flowers to make nosegayes for his
mistris; now drawing to a closure, he rants it first
<i>in cuerpo</i>, and vapouring it with gingling spurs, and
his armes a kenbol like a Don Diego he strouts it,
and by the loftiness of his gate, plaies the Capitan
Spavento; then in the very twinkling of an eye, you
would have seen him againe issue forth with a cloak
upon his arm, in a livery garment, thereby representing
the serving-man; and lastly, at one time
amongst those other, he came out with a long gray
beard, and bucked ruff, crouching on a staff tip't, with
the head of a barber's cithern,<a name="FNanchor_266_269" id="FNanchor_266_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_269" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and his gloves
hanging by a button at his girdle.</p>

<p>"Those fifteen several personages did he represent
with such excellency of garb, and exquisiteness of
language, that condignely to perpend the subtlety of
the invention, the method of the disposition, the
neatness of the elocution, the gracefulness of the
action, and wonderful variety in the so dextrous
performance of all, you would have taken it for a
comedy of five acts, consisting of three scenes, each
composed by the best poet in the world, and acted
by fifteen of the best players that ever lived, as was
most evidently made apparent to all the spectators
in the fifth and last hour of his action, (which, according
to our western account, was about six a clock at
night, and by the calculation of that country, half an
hour past three and twenty, at that time of the yeer),
for, purposing to leave off with the setting of the
sun, with an endeavour nevertheless to make his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
conclusion the master-piece of the work, he, to that
effect, summoning all his spirits together, which
never failed to be ready at the call of so worthy a
commander, did by their assistance, so conglomerate,
shuffle, mix, and interlace the gestures, inclinations,
actions, and very tones of the speech of those fifteen
several sorts of men, whose carriages he did personate
into an inestimable <i>ollapodrida</i> of immaterial
morsels of divers kinds, suitable to the very
ambrosian relish of the Heliconian nymphs, that,
in the peripetia of this drammatical exercitation,
by the inchanted transportation of the eyes and
eares of its spectabundal auditorie, one would have
sworne that they all had looked with multiplying
glasses, and that, (like that angel in the Scripture
whose voice was said to be like the voice of a
multitude), they heard in him alone the promiscuous
speech of fifteen several actors; by the various
ravishments of the excellencies whereof, in the
frolickness of a jocund straine beyond expectation,
the logofascinated spirits of the beholding hearers
and auricularie spectators, were so on a sudden
seazed upon in their risible faculties of the soul,
and all their vital motions so universally affected
in this extremitie of agitation, that, to avoid the
inevitable charmes of his intoxicating ejaculations,
and the accumulative influences of so powerfull a
transportation, one of my lady Dutchess' chief
maids of honour, by the vehemencie of the shock of
those incomprehensible raptures, burst forth into a
laughter to the rupture of a veine in her body; and
another young lady, by the irresistible violence of
the pleasure unawares infused, where the tender
receptibilitie of her too tickled fancie was least able
to hold out, so unprovidedly was surprised, that,
with no less impetuositie of ridibundal passion
then [than], (as hath been told), occasioned a fracture
in the other young ladie's modestie, she, not being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
able longer to support the well beloved burthen of
so excessive delight, and intransing joys of such
mercurial exhilations through the ineffable extasie
of an overmastered apprehension, fell back in a
swown, without the appearance of any other life
into her then [than] what, by the most refined wits
of theological speculators, is conceived to be exerced
by the purest parts of the separated entelechises of
blessed saints in their sublimest conversations with
the celestial hierarchies; this accident procured the
incoming of an apothecary with restoratives, as the
other did that of a surgeon with consolidative medicaments.<a name="FNanchor_267_270" id="FNanchor_267_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_270" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
The Admirable Crichtoun now perceiving
that it was drawing somewhat late, and that our
occidental rays of Ph&#339;bus were upon their turning
oriental to the other hemisphere of the terrestrial
globe; being withall jealous that the uninterrupted
operation of the exuberant diversitie of his jovialissime
entertainment, by a continuate winding up of
the humours there present to a higher, yet higher,
and still higher pitch, above the supremest Lydian
note of the harmonie of voluptuousness, should, in
such a case, through the too intensive stretching of
the already super-elated strings of their imagination,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
with a transcendencie over-reaching Ela, and beyond
the well concerted gain of rational equanimitie, involve
the remainder of that illustrious companie into
the sweet labyrinth and mellifluent anfractuosities of
a lacinious delectation, productive of the same inconveniences
which befel the two afore-named ladies;
whose delicacie of constitution, though sooner overcome,
did not argue, but that the same extranean
causes from him proceeding of their pathetick alteration,
might by a longer insisting in an efficacious
agencie, and unremitted working of all the consecutively
imprinted degrees that the capacity of the
patient is able to containe, prevaile at last, and have
the same predominancie over the dispositions of the
strongest complexioned males of that splendid society,
did, in his own ordinary wearing apparel, with the
countenance of a Prince, and garb befitting the
person of a so well bred gentleman and cavalier,
&#954;&#945;&#964; &#949;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#951;&#957; full of majestie, and repleat with all excogitable
civilitie, (to the amazement of all that beheld
his heroick gesture), present himself to epilogate this
his almost extemporanean comedie, though of five
hours continuance without intermission; and that
with a peroration so neatly uttered, so distinctly
pronounced, and in such elegancie of selected tearmes,
expressed by a diction so periodically contexed with
isocoly of members, that the matter thereof tending
in all humility to beseech the highnesses of the
Duke, Prince, and Dutchess, together with the
remanent lords, ladies, knights, gentlemen, and
others of both sexes of that honourable convention,
to vouchsafe him the favour to excuse his that afternoon's
escaped extravagancies, and to lay the blame
of the indigested irregularity of his wits' excursions,
and the abortive issues of his disordered brain, upon
the customarily dispensed with priviledges in those
Cisalpinal regions, to authorize such like impertinencies
at Carnavalian festivals; and that, although,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
according to the meet commonly received opinion in
that country, after the nature of Load-him, (a game
at cards), where he that wins loseth, he who, at that
season of the year, playeth the fool most egregiously,
is reputed the wisest man; he, nevertheless, not
being ambitious of the fame of enjoying good qualities,
by vertue of the antiphrasis of the fruition of
bad ones, did meerly undergo that emancipatorie
task of a so profuse liberty, and to no other end
embraced the practising of such roaming and exorbitant
diversions but to give an evident, or rather
infallible, demonstration of his eternally bound duty
to the House of Mantua, and all inviolable testimony
of his never to be altered designe, in prosecuting all
the occasions possible to be laid hold on that can in
any manner of way prove conducible to the advancement
of, and contributing to, the readiest means for
improving those advantages that may best promove
the faculties of making all his choice endeavours,
and utmost abilities at all times, effectual to the
long-wished-for furtherance of his most cordial and
endeared service to the serenissime highnesses of
My Lord Duke, Prince, and Dutchess, and of consecrating
with all addicted obsequiousness, and submissive
devotion, his everlasting obedience to the
illustrious shrine of their joynt commands. Then
incontinently addressing himself to the Lords, ladies
and others of that rotonda, (which, for his daigning
to be its inmate, though but for that day, might be
accounted in nothing inferior to the great Colisee of
Rome, or Amphitheater of Neems), with a stately
carriage, and port suitable to so prime a gallant, he
did cast a look on all the corners thereof, so bewitchingly
amiable and magically efficacious as if in his
eys had bin a muster of ten thousand cupids eagerly
striving who should most deeply pierce the hearts of
the spectators with their golden darts. And truly
so it fell out, (that there not being so much as one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
arrow shot in vain), all of them did love him, though
not after the same manner, nor for the same end;
for, as the manna of the Arabian desarts is said to
have had in the mouths of the Egyptian Israelites,
the very same tast of the meat they loved best, so
the Princes that were there did mainly cherish him
for his magnanimity and knowledge; his courtliness
and sweet behaviour being that for which chiefly the
noblemen did most respect him; for his pregnancie
of wit, and chivalric in vindicating the honour of
ladies, he was honoured by the knights, and the
esquires and other gentlemen courted him for his
affability and good fellowship; the rich did favour
him for his judgment and ingeniosity; and for his
liberality and munificence he was blessed by the
poor; the old men affected him for his constancie
and wisdome, and the young for his mirth and
gallantry; the scholars were enamoured of him
for his learning and eloquence, and the souldiers for
his integrity and valour; the merchants, for his
upright dealing and honesty, praised and extolled
him, and the artificers for his goodness and
benignity; the chastest lady of that place would
have hugged and imbraced him for his discretion
and ingenuity; whilst for his beauty and comeliness
of person he was, at least in the fervency of their
desires, the paramour of the less continent; he was
dearly beloved of the fair women, because he was
handsome, and of the fairest more dearly, because
he was handsomer: in a word, the affections of the
beholders, (like so many several diameters drawn
from the circumference of their various intents), did
all concenter in the point of his perfection. After
a so considerable insinuation, and gaining of so
much ground upon the hearts of the auditory, (though
in a shorter space then [than] the time of a flash of
lightning), he went on, (as before), in the same thred
of the conclusive part of his discourse, with a resolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>tion
not to cut it, till the overabounding passions
of the company, their exorbitant motions and discomposed
gestures, through excess of joy and mirth,
should be all of them quieted, calmed, and pacified,
and every man, woman, and maid there, (according
to their humour), resented in the same integrity they
were at first; which when by the articulatest
elocution of the most significant words, expressive
of the choisest things that fancie could suggest, and,
conforme to the matter's variety, elevating or depressing,
flat or sharply accinating it, with that proportion
of tone that was most consonant with the purpose,
he had attained unto, and by his verbal harmony and
melodious utterance, setled all their distempered
pleasures, and brought their disorderly raised spirits
into their former capsuls, he with a tongue tip't with
silver, after the various diapasons of all his other
expressions, and making of a leg for the spruceness
of its courtsie, of greater decorement to him then
[than] cloth of gold and purple, farewel'd the
companie with a complement of one period so
exquisitely delivered, and so well attended by the
gracefulness of his hand and foot, with the quaint
miniardise of the rest of his body, in the performance
of such ceremonies as are usual at a court-like
departing, that from the theater he had gone into a
lobie, from thence along three spacious chambers,
whence descending a back staire, he past through
a low gallerie which led him to that outer gate,
where a coach with six horses did attend him, before
that magnificent convention of both sexes, (to whom
that room, wherein they all were, seemed in his
absence to be as a body without a soul), had the full
leisure to recollect their spirits, (which, by the neatness
of his so curious a close, were <i>quoquoversedly</i>
scattered with admiration), to advise on the best
expediency how to dispose of themselves for the
future of that [delightful] night."</p>

lawyers in court when "Pantagruel gave judgment upon the

is the author of the above description who is the translator of the
narrative which tells of that wonderfully satisfactory decision.
"As for the counsellors, and other doctors in the law that were
there present, they were all so ravished with admiration at the
more than humane wisdom of Pantagruel, which they did most
clearly perceive to be in him, by his so accurate decision of this so
difficult and thornie cause, that their spirits, with the extremity of
the rapture, being elevated above the pitch of actuating the organs
of the body, they fell into a trance and sudden extasie, wherein
they stayed for the space of three long houres; and had been so as
yet, in that condition, had not some good people fetched store of
vinegar and rose water to bring them again into their former
sense and understanding, for the which God be praised everywhere.
And so be it." (<i>Rabelais</i>, ii. 13.)</p></div>

<p>"The whole volume is very amusing reading."&mdash;<i>St. Martin's-le-Grand.</i></p>

quaint, and the subject matter fresh and interesting."&mdash;<i>Scottish Notes
and Queries.</i></p>

<p>"A delightful little volume.... A book of no ordinary interest."&mdash;<i>Presbyterian.</i></p>

<p>"The picture of a man of remarkable vigour and individuality of
character."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"A really readable little book, which should find a considerably
wider public than that of the Shetland Islands."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

worthily told in this little volume."&mdash;<i>Aberdeen Free Press.</i></p>

times it covers, and is specially interesting from the uniqueness of the
character of Mr. Mill."&mdash;<i>North British Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>"A curious and interesting picture of old Shetland life."&mdash;<i>Elgin
Courant.</i></p>

life."&mdash;<i>Banffshire Journal.</i></p>

attracted a good deal of attention."&mdash;<i>Northern Ensign.</i></p>

interested in Scotland and her past."&mdash;<i>Liverpool Daily Post.</i></p>

<p>"We can recommend the book as interesting to many more than
Shetland readers."&mdash;<i>Life and Work.</i></p>

<p>"One can see what a romance Stevenson could have constructed out
of Mill's diary, which seems incredibly old-fashioned and primitive."&mdash;<i>Sketch.</i></p>

<p>"A most interesting and readable volume, containing many quaint
and curious pictures of Shetland life and manners during last century."&mdash;<i>Orkney
Herald.</i></p>

memorable."&mdash;<i>United Presbyterian Record.</i></p>

us acquainted with a character which ought not to be forgotten."&mdash;<i>Free
Church Monthly.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Mill stands out as quite a remarkable man. Though the
volume will have a special interest to the people of the Shetland Isles,
it will be read with much interest on the mainland."&mdash;<i>Perthshire
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"A succinct and readable account of Mill's life.... Nothing
essential has been omitted, and nothing unnecessary has been retained....
The volume furnishes interesting reading from beginning to end."&mdash;<i>Shetland
News.</i></p>

<p>"The book is eminently readable, and will well repay perusal....
A vein of quiet humour, mingled with delicate satire, crops up every
here and there in its pages."&mdash;<i>Shetland Times.</i></p>

this little Life of the most typical and 'Famous Scot' that his countrymen have

and sound."&mdash;<i>Scots Pictorial.</i></p>

<p><b>Mungo Park.</b> By <span class="smcap">T. Banks Maclachlan</span>.</p>

<p>"Not only a charming life-story, if at times a pathetic one, but a vivid chapter in
the romance of Africa."&mdash;<i>Leeds Mercury.</i></p>

<p><b>David Hume.</b> By <span class="smcap">Henry Calderwood</span>, LL.D.</p>

<p>"Fulfils admirably well the purpose of the writer, which was that of presenting in
clear, fair, and concise lines Hume and his philosophy to the mind of his countrymen
and of the world."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p><b>William Dunbar.</b> By <span class="smcap">Oliphant Smeaton</span>.</p>

<p>"A graphic and informed account not only of the man and his works, but of his

<p><b>Sir William Wallace.</b> By Professor <span class="smcap">Murison</span>.</p>

<p><b>Robert Louis Stevenson.</b> By <span class="smcap">Margaret M. Black</span>.</p>

<p>"Certainly one of the most charming biographies we have ever come across.
The writer has style, sympathy, distinction, and understanding. We were loth to
put the book aside. Its one fault is that it is too short."&mdash;<i>Outlook.</i></p>

<p><b>Thomas Reid.</b> By Professor <span class="smcap">Campbell Fraser</span>.</p>

<p>"Supplies what must be allowed to be a distinct want in our literature, in the
shape of a brief, popular, and accessible biography of the founder of the so-called
Scottish School of Philosophy, written with notable perspicuity and sympathy by
one who has made a special study of the problems that engaged the mind of Reid."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p><b>Pollok and Aytoun.</b> By <span class="smcap">Rosaline Masson</span>.</p>

<p>"Miss Masson tells the story of the lives of her two subjects in a bright and
readable way. Her criticisms are sound and judicious, and altogether the little
volume is a very acceptable addition to the series."&mdash;<i>North British Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p><b>Adam Smith.</b> By <span class="smcap">Hector C. Macpherson</span>.</p>

us, an attractive and interesting figure."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"This biography of him will be highly esteemed because of the grace and vigour
with which Miss Haldane has done her work. To the 'Famous Scots' series of
volumes there have been many excellent contributions, but not one of them is more
interesting than this latest addition."&mdash;<i>Dundee Courier.</i></p>

<p><b>King Robert the Bruce.</b> By Professor <span class="smcap">Murison</span>.</p>

<p>"Professor Murison has given us a book for which not only Scots, but every man
who can appreciate a record of great days worthily told, will be grateful."&mdash;<i>Morning
Leader.</i></p>

<p>"The story of Bruce is brilliantly told in clear and flexible language, which
draws the reader on with the interest of a novel. Professor Murison is a most
impartial and thoroughly reliable critic, and may be followed with confidence by all
who desire a truthful and unprejudiced picture of this greatest of the Scots."&mdash;<i>Aberdeen

<p>Transcriber's Notes: Hyphenation has been standardized, for instance,
"footnote" rather than "foot-note". Spelling has not been standardized,
for instance "Lieutenant-General" and "Lieutenant-Generall", or
"falsehood" and "falshood". The period following a royal's roman number
belongs, for instance, "King Charles. is". </p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
